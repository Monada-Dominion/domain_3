PART 1 - ACTIVE FORCE
***the Spider***
Observing the passage of time through a rectangular frame, the spider could hardly notice how day after day it was, in exactly the same way as he saw it, but in a slightly distorted form, reflected on the backgammon board, on the field for growing poppies, on the TV, in a corner office, littered with furniture, but still possessing everything necessary for working in the field of opium production, as well as in space and in its nature of rotating bodies, in the higher levels of matter and in imperceptible information processes. Everything the spider could see was placed in the gap between the toilet railing and the floor. Most likely he was left there so that one could see if someone was using the restroom or not. The amazing ability of windows and doors to become a kind of frame made this opening a picture depicting Time.
The change in lighting in the room was the only way to track what time it was now in that room. From seven in the morning until ten in the evening, fluorescent lamps were burning there, which completely replaced natural light. In the evening, the daylight turned off and the night light turned on, assembled from one incandescent lamp and a cucumber jar, which played the role of a chandelier. If you try to describe what the spider could see in its dynamic picture, you would get something like this: a floor upholstered with long wooden planks painted in dark brown color, the lower part of the table and bench legs, assembled from roughly welded pieces of iron and painted in light green color, as well as the bottom of the bedside table is dark brown, the baseboard is the same color as the floor, a little wall, the same color as the table, and he also saw the legs of people in sportswear and slippers moving around the room and, of course, the spider saw the lighting changes. Sometimes one of these human beings moving around the room brought trapped flies to the spider. No one knows what prompted him to do this, because the spider had a completely tolerable net for this type of fishing and did not need help. Perhaps this was due to boredom, or perhaps in view of some kind of secret relationship that could exist between human beings and a spider, locked together in one confined space. Moreover, the creatures regularly, for some reason, blew on the spider, because of which he had to crawl deeper into the corner and hide under his web. And once a man, incommensurably huge in relation to a tiny spider, lit and held a match next to him. No, he didn’t hurt him, he didn’t burn the insect, and the spider didn’t even have to run away to the corner, he just calmly looked at the fire, and, perhaps, saw it for the first time.
Flame, how closely it is associated with time. In the distant depths of space, the flame gathers into huge balls that revolve around themselves, and sometimes around each other, creating structures of two, three or more rotating burning bodies. These balls are so huge that they attract other objects to themselves, which are held many kilometers from their centers. The strange and incomprehensible nature of these flaming magnets causes other smaller balls to rotate around them and spin on their axis, rotating, in turn, even smaller balls, in which there is practically no fire. But on Earth it exists and there is a lot of it here. Moreover, this fire is amenable to control and study, in which human beings living on this planet have achieved considerable success. Of course, they have not yet fully mastered all possible forms and methods of using fire potential. The representative of the human race, who showed fire to a spider, removed it from thin wooden chips, one end of which had been previously placed in a sulfur solution. In contact with a box specially prepared for extracting the fire, the sulfur ignited under the action of friction, and the wood chips served as fuel for combustion for the next few seconds. The likelihood that the spider could catch even a small part of this process was negligible, but this is only at first glance. Perhaps an insect, accustomed to feeding through net fishing, and moving with ropes strong enough for its weight, could have information about firepower. If the flame, which originally existed only in distant space, reached the corner of that very spider, which is quite difficult to reach for any of the human beings, with the exception of some who have to stay in the room described above due to life circumstances, then it is likely that knowledge about fire was in this corner long before the desire to show the flame to a spider in one of human beings appeared.
Information about the fact that under strong pressure and due to friction there is an impulse that accelerates the movement of particles, which human beings perceive as an increase in temperature, must be contained directly inside these particles. Otherwise, it would not be a law, and the particles would not be accelerated every time, and sometimes they would behave completely differently, unpredictably. And this would turn the notorious phenomenon, known among human beings as a “box of matches” into a little elephant, or into a watch, or even into a lake with reeds every time a match is struck against its flaming box. 
However, there is a law that makes particles behave exactly the same in the same conditions and situations. This law exists, thus, it is possible to apply the functions of the intellectual center to it, or to comprehend and express it in writing, to give it a logical conclusion. If there is such a possibility, then the information that the intellectual center can process and transform, in one form or another, must be contained within the object that is being analyzed. In this case, these are sulfur molecules that ignite when rubbed against the side of a box of matches. The presence of a constant sequence of manifestations of the same behavior of different particles during friction makes information about combustion a law. With a sufficiently strong acceleration of particles, substances begin to change their physical state, passing into steam, or water, or begin to burn or melt. Fire, in turn, in most situations transmits a stronger impulse than friction, which causes many substances to ignite immediately or for a short time. Accordingly, there is a possibility that the spider has already encountered frictional force while sliding along its ropes and was aware of temperature changes inside its body and inside its own web. Its tiny legs could have repeatedly heated up and cooled down due to the productive work on the creation of the next net or rope. In addition to knowledge about the force of friction, the spider could have information that some floors and walls transfer heat to its body, which makes it possible to have information about the law of energy transfer inside the presence of the spider. It is unlikely that he possessed a clear formulation of laws and mathematical formulas, but perhaps he had his own spider-like concepts of the forces acting in nature. And if this is really so, then the spider could be absolutely not interested in watching a flaming match, which made the desire of a human being to transmit this information to the spider absolutely useless. Likewise, the desire of another human being to feed a spider with caught flies could be completely useless. In any case, feeding and training a spider are two meaningless activities that have manifested themselves only because of the illusory feeling of kinship between humans and the spider. The only thing that had meaning in this relationship was Time.

***the Time***
Time is relative, time does not exist, time can only be perceived by a person and only from his position, this is a coordinate system, an illusion - so they say, but is it really so? Time certainly exists, but the probability that someone knows that this is a crystal is approximately equal to the probability that a spider knows the laws of friction and the principles of energy transfer. On the other hand, for someone who knows that Time is a crystal, there can be no doubt that there are other beings who have a similar, and maybe exactly the same view of the nature of things. Moreover, one who knows that Time is a crystal will be one hundred percent sure that the spider has direct and perfect knowledge of the nature of the flame and its power. After all, if Time is a crystal, then wherever it manifests itself, all particles must be connected to each other and be inside one crystal lattice, which determines the shape, structure and growth processes of a given crystal of time. In this case, there is no doubt, and there can be no doubt that the spider knew about the intention of a human being to light a match and demonstrate fire to it.
The information that originated in the presence of a human being as a desire to light a fire and demonstrate a match spread through the particles of his general presence, mixed with his atmosphere and transmitted through space into the atmosphere of the spider and into the general presence of the latter. Once inside the presence of the spider, information instantly became available to him. The only question is whether the spider was conscious enough to comprehend the information received and draw any conclusions. Perhaps he did not attach much importance to this event, since it did not play any role for him, or perhaps he decided not to show that he was bored, and just silently looked at the fire in order to satisfy the desire of a human being to engage in educational activities. After all, if the insect knew about the imminent ignition of the match, then it probably knew that after such a demonstration a person would begin to talk about the effect produced on the spider. From the point of view of a human being, the effect on a spider could be similar to an evolutionary push. In the event that a spider had never encountered fire and heat transfer before, the demonstration of a lit match could prompt him to think about substances and their effect on living things. 
The spider could have known about such reflections of a human being only because they served as an incentive for the demonstration of the match and were supposed to continue after. But if he had the ability to be aware of the flow of information from a human being, then he should have had the ability to transfer information back. In this case, a wordless dialogue between two beings would deprive one of the interlocutors of the impulse that prompts them to perform an unnecessary and meaningless action associated with the demonstration of fire, and would also eliminate speculation about the evolutionary impact of this process. The impulse of a human being would have disappeared the moment it reached the spider's atmosphere, and that would have happened almost at the same moment it was born. But since this did not happen, assuming that both the spider and the human being had a sufficient measure of consciousness to track and process information spreading in space along with particles, it can be assumed that the action associated with the demonstration of a burning match could be aesthetic and probably even religious.
Fire has a magical power incomprehensible to a simple human being, which has a bewitching effect on his consciousness. Not everyone can watch a burning flame for hours, and even fewer are aware of what this flame really is. Nevertheless, some conscious individuals can be attached to the contemplation of fire, both celestial and earthly, and to a certain extent, their hidden meaning from a superficial glance is revealed to them. This is not about the empirical view of Western science on the physical component of the nature of fire and fiery bodies. The secret meaning of the flame and the processes associated with it is hidden in the complex and all-encompassing awareness of the presence of the element of fire in all substances existing in the universe, including water and living beings. And if the silent interlocutors possessed at least a grain of this perfect knowledge, then they could derive an unlimited amount of benefit from one match lit for a few seconds. After all, even a simple flash of light or a fiery spark can be enough for a deep immersion in a meditative state. Concentration on light matter or flame within one's own or someone else's presence allows one to achieve awareness of the potential of life energy and control over it. All living beings contain a certain amount of this matter, some more, others less. This is not to say that quantity determines the state, rather it is determined by the quality of use and the ability to concentrate. 
At a sufficiently high level of concentration, a few fractions of a second are enough to restore vitality and balance the mental and emotional state. But this does not mean that a longer concentration carries a lower level of concentration depth. Everything depends entirely on the current situation and intention. In the case of a spider and a human being, it is permissible to assume that at the moment the match burns, time has stopped. An external, uninitiated observer, if there was such a thing, could notice that the match burned for only a few seconds, but for the spider and the one who lit this match, the moment lasted for an eternity. This flame contained everything: emotions, feelings, sensations, thoughts, desires, knowledge about all things, phenomena and objects, about everything that is on earth and in heaven, there was God and the devil. No one said anything, but an exchange of information took place, and it was clear to both participants in the silent conversation that the moment, which lasted only a few seconds, was filled with truth. This is possible only if the one who transmits the information and the one who perceives it, both realize that Time is a crystal and not only know this, but also fully understand it, with all their being, mind, heart and with the body they experience the given Truth.
The Time Crystal is nothing more than the subtlest and highest level of organization of matter in our universe. This is the Absolute, the quintessence of absolute knowledge, expressed in objects, energies, information and processes of their interaction. The statement that Time is a crystal implies that Time is material, which means it really exists. Moreover, it exists not just as a philosophical concept intended for memorization and retelling in universities, but as a living, extremely conscious and highly developed being. Time has gradation, relativity, feeling, rhythm, intelligence, all that is inherent in man and all that he does not have. 
There is no linearity for time, nothing is irreversible. It is limitless, eternal, all-pervading and can do anything. For humans, it is relative - we count time by the rotation of the Earth around its axis and by rotation around the Sun. We use a clock and a calendar. In space, Time flows differently, each planet and star has its own intervals and time phases. Their duration differs from each other, and there is a conditional time that is present in the relationship of two objects unrelated in one rotational system. Despite the lack of visible connection and attraction, both are still there. 
The connection is in the nature of the crystal, just as the web is in the nature of the spider. It is thanks to this invisible connection that Time is a crystal. Just as heat is transferred in the form of an impulse from one atom in the crystal lattice to another, Time flows from one object to another. The mechanism of a wrist watch, consisting of many interconnected parts, makes the watch a mirror of Time. Rotating, one wheel moves the next, then another and another, like domino particles that fall on each other, but their number never ends and the movement does not stop. At one point, the movement returns to the beginning and everything is repeated. Time is cyclical, its processes occur with a certain amount of repetitions, worked out options, strategies and scenarios. There are no accidents, everything is subject to the law of cause and effect. For an uninitiated observer of time, this law is hidden, there is no way to discover it, and therefore much looks random and unrelated, and even more so, there is no way to realize that Time is a crystal.
The Law makes Time flow in both directions. The age-old question of whether Time flows from the past to the future or from the future to the past has no answer. It flows simultaneously forward and backward, as well as in all other directions, and most importantly, it can stop. This distinguishes living and present Time from what the so-called learned human beings think about it. Some particularly inquisitive minds believe that without their existence nothing would have happened, that if they had not seen something, then this would not have existed, and if they did not keep track of time, it would again be lost. On the one hand, to think so is even a little impudent and offensive for Time. On the other hand, this is only a minor delusion of some human beings. These creatures represent the majority of all living organisms of their species. This situation, again, is a law reflected in our universe. The law implies that we can observe only one percent of a hundred, and the ninety-nine remaining percent lie in the world of invisible information processes. One percent is gross matter, accessible to us in sensations by the five senses, and the ninety-nine remaining percent we can feel only through the perception of the effect of their presence in one or another area of ​​our life. In the situation with Time, one hundredth of one percent of the general information about it is hardly known. And in a situation with conscious beings who do not have delusions about reality, ordinary human beings do not know anything at all about their life and nature.

***the Backgammon***
The probability that a certain event will occur in certain coordinates is present in these coordinates long before the actual occurrence of this event. The crystalline nature of reality contains information about the structure and manifestation of things and information about the possibility and likelihood of certain events occurring. It resembles something that some human beings call Destiny. As if everything that can ever happen is already recorded in the appropriate place and realizes itself as a certain time comes. 
Is that possible? Human beings cannot answer this question with certainty. More precisely, they cannot prove either for or against it. Assuming that all events are indeed recorded somewhere, like a script, absolutely any possibility of the existence of free will disappears. People, like mindless automates, mechanically set in motion, throw the dice on the backgammon board, which creates the illusion of the uncertainty of the future. The chips are moved to one of the twenty-four existing places, the turn passes to the other player. Fields, like stretches of Time, delay and let those who are about to pass. First, day passes, then night, and everything eventually returns to the beginning. Some fields, like a clock, last longer, and the chips are on them in debt, others are faster, and the chips do not linger, and some do not miss at all or are never occupied, which either leads one of the players to an inevitable loss, or does not affect in any way on him. It's like not noticing a couple of hours of wasted time, or dying and forever frozen in the moment when he left this world.
Not to notice how Time passed means not to notice anything that surrounded you. If Time manifests itself as a functioning and living material world then not to notice how it passes can only be done with a mostly or completely switched attention to some object or subject of thought, a source of experiences. Being busy with an interesting thing, distracted by dreams, reflections or experiences, a human being can stop tracking the phenomena and events around him. This situation is a consequence of the disconnected nature of the functioning of the human body, the separation of its personality and essence. At one point, the body of a focused person throws the dice, experiences emotions about the expected result and ponders a further strategy. When this does not happen, the human body makes a mechanical throw, emotions are directed at objects shown on TV and thoughts are directed at thinking about what to cook for dinner. 
In the first case, Time will not be noticeable due to the fact that the person is completely focused on the game and is identified with the process in which it takes part. In the second, due to the fact that the person is identified with the environment. During identification, the human "I" disappears, it is completely replaced by produced or observed processes, phenomena and thoughts. We can say that there is simply no man, but there is only what he is doing, he is a part of the system, an instrument. The presence of the human "I" determines the possibility of correct and comprehensive tracking of Time. When the "I"exists, Time does not disappear, and when the "I" does not exist, it disappears. Without Time there is no life, and without life there is no point in performing any actions. A dead person who is nominally still alive, has a functioning body, brain and heart, but not an integral human "I", cannot perform any actions. All his activity is an illusion that has no meaning or value. He acts mechanically, produces a reaction to external stimuli, therefore he is not aware of what is happening. There is no one and nothing to give an account with, and also there is no one and nothing to keep track of Time.
That human being who demonstrated fire to an insect had to have an integral and indivisible “I” in order to perform such serious and meaningful action. Otherwise, there would be no sense in such a deep and metaphysical process as contemplation of fire together with a silent interlocutor, who has perhaps a perfect idea of ​​the nature of a fiery substance. Moreover, the possibility of at first glance a long duration of a short moment would disappear, and the likelihood of extracting such a huge benefit from one burning match would definitely disappear. But such an opportunity was and remains till this day. The key factor confirming the presence of a holistic "I" in the presence of a human being and a spider was that not only one human being established a relationship with the inhabitant of the network, but also another representative of the human species had contact with the insect. 
The second one brought it caught, but still quite live flies. Such an act of feeding a spider indicates that the need for food, which originated in the presence of such a small but so influential insect, as well as the need to receive fiery energy, was transmitted through the atmosphere to human beings without any words or body movements. Everything happened as if by prior arrangement. Moreover, the spider's observation of the passage of Time in his abode was not limited to just contemplation of movements and light changes in the opening that represented the picture frame. The spider's knowledge of the manifestation of Time in the form of a game of backgammon and other similar processes is confirmed by the existence of a connection between it and the representatives of the human race. Human beings who lived in the same room with a spider possessed knowledge of different time processes and had a positive relationship with the insect, felt compassion for it and provided help. They could convey not only information about their intentions, but also part or all of their knowledge about the universe available to them.
The possession of an integral “I” implies the presence of conscious behavior in the presence of human beings. When the integral “I” is absent, there is no possibility in any way to comprehend the information coming from the atmosphere. Behavior can be considered conscious only:
when a person behaves, first of all, attentively towards the world around him and other living beings, 
when provides all possible assistance in the development of the world and improvement of living conditions, 
when makes efforts to develop an understanding of the nature of things within presences of other living beings. 

All this could be observed in the behavior of those human beings who were in a certain relationship with the spider. At first glance an extremely small and insignificant representative of the insect kingdom.

***the Poppy Field***
A game of backgammon, ancient enough to spread throughout the world, was present in the room where the spider was. To be honest, it was there even before the appearance of human beings, respectively, the spider could be well acquainted with it and, probably, was a good player. This game is generally very popular among the inhabitants of similar premises, but it is even more popular among the inhabitants of that part of the planet inhabited by human beings, which is called the East. And what happens to be popular among the inhabitants of the East definitely happens among those who work in the poppy fields. It is reasonable to assume that there are some very good and even excellent backgammon players among the workers employed in the collection and processing of poppy emulsion. It is impossible to say how high their level of professionalism in this game is and how good it is, as well as their level of professionalism in the field of collecting opium, but the latter is extremely high. Afghan opium has spread throughout the world as ubiquitous as backgammon. We can say that wherever there is backgammon, there is also opium, or at least it was there, but now it is no longer there. In this situation, however, as elsewhere, there is a time paradox. Opium was, and it is no longer there, or opium was not, and it is not yet, but perhaps it will soon appear. Or maybe it was, but disappeared for a certain period of time and will appear later. It is in view of this uncertainty associated with the presence of opium that it, like nothing else, is suitable for the study of the nature of Time.
The poppy field, like everything present in the reality given to human beings, is nothing more than a fragment of a common crystal of Time. This is not the largest area of ​​total mass, but it is quite influential, at least within the planet Earth and maybe even within the solar system. One poppy field may have its own army, which contains professional gardeners, opium pickers, movers, scientists, tasters, military men, drivers, pilots, financiers, managers and generally human beings of all professions, all kinds of premises, machinery and equipment. The fact is that the production of high-quality opium is a very profitable type of business, and that is why these, at first glance, flowers, but in fact above-planetary formations, have such massive resources in their full disposal. The power of these super planetary formations is entirely based on the total suppression of human individuality. Simply being close to one of the representatives of this kingdom can make any human being a slave to this super planetary formation. And when this happens, the newly minted servant immediately falls into a highly organized and ordered system. He is assigned a personal number, from which all possible information for a personal file is collected and placed in a database to which representatives of the Poppy Dominion  have access from anywhere in the universe. After registration, a human being receives the most complete list of responsibilities in the universe and the most complete guide to action, which will contain information on how to spend every second of the remaining life. Of course, with the exception of the minimum amount of time allotted for sleep, and even less time spent eating and emptying, a human being will spend all the remaining time until the end of his life working in the field of opium production. This situation does not leave any opportunity for creating a family, self-development and self-realization, with the exception of career growth in this area, and it also does not allow self-determination and devotion to anything other than work responsibilities. Everything is prohibited at work except work and communication. Due to the fact that communication is the only thing that employees of the described sphere have, their conversations turn out to be “extremely mediocre and devoid of any meaning”, as evidenced by those who have heard them. Due to the fact that the workers lack any individuality, all their communication in the poppy field is an "unusually emotional cacophony", which, according to those who have heard it, cannot be called anything else. And how these workers find time to play backgammon is a big question, since the body, emotions and thoughts of such workers are, as mentioned above, in an extremely depressed state, which makes them incredibly manageable and suggestible. The way to achieve such control over human beings is kept under the strictest confidence by the Poppy Dominion , but something has leaked out to the masses.
Several times a day, the average employee in the opium industry uses the opium product as intended and does so with a great deal of confidence. Given the fact that every worker is in the database and has a guide for every second of his life, it is very reasonable to assume that the use of the final or intermediate product of the opium industry is an integral part of the work process, which, of course, is spelled out in the manual with all the details and explanations. But there can be no instructions about playing backgammon in the manual. This is absolutely certain, because backgammon can easily take away from employees the time that they have to spend according to the schedule on fulfilling their duties, which backgammon is clearly not. It is possible that the workers confuse the backgammon board and the poppies, since the objects are similar. Both are manifestations of Time, which definitely implies some degree of kinship. Also, workers sometimes spend more than the allotted time fiddling with needles and pipes, since these items are also a manifestation of Time. And it was thanks to this seemingly imperceptible kinship that the spider knew that dice were often thrown in his room, and there was often talk of a poppy. It is impossible to say with certainty whether opium was present in this room, but such a fact cannot be ruled out. And if he was there, then the spider knew for sure about the situation in the poppy fields. And if he was not there, then, most likely, he will appear there, since he has such a feature - to appear over time wherever there is something that creates an attraction for him.
Gravity and attractive power are laws ubiquitous in our universe. Fortunately, these laws have exceptions and variations, which sometimes completely reverse their nature. Thanks to this, black holes can be observed, and where there are black holes, Time is likely to be distorted there, which is generally considered incredible. But, as noted earlier, Time is not limited and can act as it pleases. Accordingly, the distortion of Time in black holes is possible and exists, and together with Time, space is also distorted. This fact is very interesting and significant in the present context. Interest and significance lies in the fact that, both within the poppies themselves, and due to the influence of the final and intermediate products obtained as a result of processing the emulsion collected from them, Time and space are subject to distortion. Alas, few of the workers in the described sphere can boast of significant knowledge in this matter, since such information, together with information about the enslavement of workers, is kept in the strictest confidence by the Poppy Dominion . The only way to get information about such issues is direct observation of black holes, and the servants of the opium industry have the opportunity to observe black holes only after using the final result of their work. But black holes, thanks to this multi-stage and time-consuming process, appear at all in the wrong place, and in order to ponder and study them for a long time, workers have neither the strength, nor the opportunity, nor, moreover, time, since they are always busy his exhausting and painstaking work in the poppy field. Therefore, mankind knows little about those places where space and Time are distorted. As for the curvatures located directly inside the opiates, they are hidden from the common sight, and once you break the box with seeds, the curvatures immediately disappear and the only thing that can then be noticed is the chambers for storing flower seeds and the presence of a white emulsion. What happens inside the poppy pods is kept by the Poppy Dominion , probably in the strictest confidence, and only a few human beings on Earth know about it. How they found out about it has to do with attraction, which plays a big role in the life of the poppy. Firstly, because the gravity of other planets in the solar system affects the yield and quality of products, and secondly, because attraction almost completely and completely controls the relationship between the Poppy Dominion  and all other living beings and inanimate objects. It is difficult to say how far in space this relationship extends, but it can be assumed that it is very far, since the extreme degree of kinship of poppies with Time makes their opinion very authoritative. Their level of influence grows every day, and along with their influence, so does the territory controlled by the Poppy Dominion . It would be more correct to say that it is not the territory that is growing, but the space controlled by the Poppy Dominion , since the power of this super planetary formation extends not only on the ground, but also inside substances and objects, as well as in air, vacuum and other dimensions. This nature of power is definitely related to the control of particles within the crystal lattice of Time and, perhaps, even has the potential to distort this lattice, which allows Poppy Dominion  to create portals for moving final and intermediate products through space to any point in our universe.
Therefore, it is possible that there was already opium in the Spider's room and will probably reappear soon. If we consider that the Spider possessed consciousness and an integral "I", and this is appreciated in any circles and, undoubtedly, gives its advantages, then through spatial telepathy the Spider could easily turn to Poppy Dominion  and leave a request to transport a certain amount of opium through portal teleportation ... And he would not have to pay much for this, since in Afghanistan a bucket of opium is very cheap, and with teleportation the price does not increase due to the absence of costs for transportation, fuel, payment for professional drivers, forgery, bribes at the border and in relevant institutions, as well as other small expenses for such influential organizations. Accordingly, in this situation and in the absence of opium in the Spider's room, it cannot be said that it may have been, and it is not now, since the opium could have been earlier, but at the time of the described actions it was not, and, most likely, and with a high degree of probability, it will soon appear in the described coordinates and in large quantities.
Another issue related to poppy fields and having a certain importance in this context is the space-time portal teleportation. If, with a simple portal teleportation, opium moves in accordance with the usual laws of Time, namely, in the current time the same at the point of departure and the point of reception at the moment of the portal existence, then with space-time teleportation everything happens quite differently. When implementing space-time teleportation, it is possible to program the time of sending and receiving in such a way that the product will go from the present to the past or from the future to the past, as well as from the past to the past, from the future to the future, from the past or future to the present, and any required way. This method of teleportation makes it possible for the Spider to receive opium in the past, and in the present, already observe the effect of using this product of the opium industry. The possibility of using this method of teleportation is entirely determined by the level of consciousness of a living being. If the usual spatial portal teleportation requires a medium level of consciousness, then space-time teleportation requires a fairly high level of consciousness. This is due to the fact that a living being needs to remember himself in the past or the future in all details, and also remember what surrounded him or will surround him in the future or the past. Otherwise, the creature will not be able to cope with the load caused by the curvature of the space-time continuum and the change in the course of events, which will lead to his death and the disappearance of his bodies up to the fourth level. This means that not only the body of a creature, its energy, soul, but also everything that has ever been produced by it or connected with it, as well as all memories of it and any information about this living being, will disappear. But the Spider did not disappear, and the presence in the room of objects akin to the poppy in spirit indicates the fact that soon the opium should have appeared, or was already there, but disappeared. In any case, there was no opium in the room for the commoner eye. Also, the question arises of why there were human beings who did not leave this room and even fed the Spider with still quite live flies. Perhaps one of these creatures knew, or at least suspected, of the Spider's connections with the Poppy Dominion  and the possibility of spatial teleportation of opium. But it is unlikely that it knew about the possibility of space-time teleportation, which did not allow it to use opium in the past or in the future, being in the present, and in the same place to observe the effect of the use of the final or intermediate product of the opium industry in the past or the future. The fact that the creature did not know about space-time teleportation and did not have a sufficiently high level of consciousness is also confirmed by the fact that it fed the Spider with caught flies, possibly for ritual purposes.
The act of feeding the Spider was a kind of sacrifice. A human being offered still living, but immobilized fly to the Spider, putting it on the net as a gift, which was supposed to appease the Spider and improve his attitude towards the donor. But this representative of the human race did not know that, having a high level of consciousness, the Spider could feed on solar and fiery matter, which is cleaner and more energetic than a half-dead fly. The Spider could receive such energy in the same way as opium, but thanks to another creature who was in the same room with him, the Spider was able to enjoy the eternity of the flame of a match burning for several seconds. Such a ritual is more ancient and more effective than the sacrifice. Contemplation of the flame does not take life away from other living beings and gives much more energy when properly handled. But the Spider's level of consciousness was so high that he accepted the gift and happily ate the fly, which created hope in the presence of a human being for an improvement in his attitude towards him. Unfortunately for this human being, it did not receive opium and continued its existence immersed in its simple affairs, playing backgammon and watching TV. Another creature, familiar with the nature of fire, took advantage of the Spider's connections with the Poppy Dominion  and was able to use opium in another time without any tragic consequences in the present. Moreover, the Spider's ties with the poppies were so strong that in order to receive all the opium sent through the portal, it was necessary to allocate another room of the same size. This allowed both the Spider and a friendly conscious human being to use opium for their not selfish, but scientific purposes at any time necessary. It was enough to enter a state of deep meditation and move your second body to the opium room. Then it could be consumed in any form and in any quantity.

***the TV***

The opium storage room had exactly the same frame as the one through which the Spider watched the Time. It was an absolutely identical room, but it was in a different dimension. In order to use opium in a different time, a special room was required - the one not subject to decay due to space-time distortions. Such a room was provided by the Poppy Dominion , since it had one free at its disposal. Usually such rooms are provided only to very large clients, since it is beneficial for the Poppy Dominion  that the client keeps the product in a safe place and continues to fill this place as the product is consumed and refilled. There were cases when opponents of the opium industry found warehouses filled to the brim with opiate and, of course, destroyed everything, but did not use it for its intended purpose. The owners of the warehouses were found, tortured, and one day it turned out that the ends of the opium industry were drawn straight to the Poppy Dominion . Then the Poppy Dominion  acted secretly, underground and on a revolutionary basis. The production was not fine-tuned, and there were not so many reliable personnel as there are today. That was a long time ago. Since then, the Poppy Dominion  has been supplying those who buy the final or intermediate product from a ton of weight with rooms located in another dimension and inaccessible to ignorant and uninitiated persons.
There are two types of undetectable rooms: limited space room and unlimited space room. Poppy Dominion  has a lot of rooms with limited space, such as the one given to the Spider, and the only thing that can happen to them is decay due to time. However, Poppy Dominion  has a contract with Time for an unlimited period, and this contract is constantly being extended due to the especially beneficial cooperation and kinship of the parties. There are only two rooms that have no space restrictions. One is used for personal purposes by the Poppy Dominion , such as, for example, production, storage, experimentation with opiates, and more. And the second room is at the disposal of Time and no one knows what is happening there. Perhaps only the top of the Poppy Dominion  knows this, since it has direct contact with Time. For everyone else, this room simply does not exist. The spider got one of the limited rooms because he bought exactly a ton. It was selfish enough on his part not to share a small fraction of the final or intermediate product of the opium industry with an incompletely conscious human being. Anyway, this is only at first and superficial glance. 
First, the Spider would share if the creature could make space-time movements, and he would not have to use opium in the present. And secondly, the energies left by the Spider and the Poppy Dominion  on opium could so strongly affect this human being that it could simply not perceive them and perish up to the third level of its existence. Therefore, only another, sufficiently conscious human being, was able to freely use opium in another dimension without hindrance and without any material costs. No one in the Spider's room knew about this, since in order to consume the final or intermediate product of the opium industry, a conscious human being was immersed in meditation for several hours and did not move from its place. There could be slight changes in its atmosphere, but they were noticeable only at the energy level and above, which made the effects of opium use invisible at the level of gross matter.
The TV was turned on in the room almost constantly, which definitely affected the state of the living beings present in the room. It was a small and old color television set that picked up twelve TV channels. The TV screen of this device was the most dynamic picture. Colors, objects and the plot were constantly changing, and when it was turned off, it resembled a picture of the famous Suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich, "Black Square". 
Television sets are inherently close to pictures, which makes them excellent transmitters of the manifestations of Time. Attention gets attracted to the screen and destroys any manifestation of the integral "I" of a person and suppresses even a rather strong desire to acquire an integral "I". The thing is that the creators of video programs, films, advertisements and everything that is broadcasted on color screens take on the obligation to control the viewer's attention. They do this because they consider the end product of their activity a reflection of how a human being sees and should see the world around him. Changing the frame, focusing, placing, perspective - all this is created so that the viewer forgets who he is and where he is, and completely takes over the perception of the director. This way of transmitting information deprives a human being of the ability to perceive objects captured on video in any other way. The meaning of lighting, the arrangement of objects in the frame, colors, lines, words, schemes and sounds, all of this and much more replaces the functions of the brain that are responsible for directing attention. The frame of the TV screen becomes a direct carrier of information to the brain of a human being and plays the role that the latter's internal vision usually occupies. It is thanks to this feature of video production that the TV is the most powerful weapon at the disposal of Time. Only the final or intermediate product of the opium industry, taken with the TV on, can be more powerful. Perhaps it is the TV that is used by the Poppy Dominion  to totally suppress the individualities of its employees.
The fact that the Spider knew about the existence of a TV in the room on the bedside table, which he could see through his Time frame, is beyond doubt. Firstly, the TV was heard, and it is very difficult to confuse the voice of the news announcer and the manner in which the news is presented with something else. Secondly, human beings, after long-term interaction with this object, filled the voids in their atmosphere with the energy transmitted by the TV. Also, the TV transmitted a certain amount of information in the presence of human beings in the same room with the Spider, which, in turn, was free from this influence, since he never watched TV directly. The spider knew that everything that is broadcasted on the TV screen is of no value and has no differences between themselves, but is only a form of message transmitted through one of many forms of information transmission, called in the environment of human beings "a TV". All, that can be gleaned from watching a TV screen, is that information is present in the form of a dynamic and sound picture on the frame of a color or black and white screen. Neither the design of the TV nor the context of the information conveyed plays any role in determining the value of the TV viewing experience. The very fact that a TV screen is used to transmit information replaces the entire context of the message. There are only two things to note about watching TV: whether anyone is watching it and that the TV is turned off and no one is watching. 
When the TV is turned on and someone is watching it, the information message is that a human or any other living being perceives information through a media conductor called TV, and not what the creature is watching. When the TV is turned off, the information message is that a human or any other living being does not perceive information through a media conductor called a TV. The delusions of human beings regarding the semantic context of information messages on the TV screen are caused by the fact that most of them do not have an integral and indivisible "I". This state of affairs allows the creators of media products to split the viewer's attention into several parts or several “I” and direct them in different directions to form the required vector of activity. The effect, after interacting with a media vehicle called television, is to generate some incentive impulses within the general presence of the human being. These impulses are formed by increasing or decreasing the activity of certain centers within the general presence of the human being.  
What is broadcasted on TV plays an extremely important role for creators and consumers of media products. But this is true to a lesser extent, since neither one nor the other has an integral and indivisible "I", which makes all their activity purely mechanical. Creators do their job because their environment demands it, and consumers act differently because they cannot resist the influence of the TV. Those who have an integral and indivisible "I" can calmly refuse to watch the TV screen or not accept the energies transmitted by the media conductor called TV, or use them to their advantage to build relationships with not fully conscious human beings in a language they understand.
Moreover, human beings with an integral and indivisible “I” can consciously create different forms of information messages that can surpass the influence of television screens and transform them from a simple media conductor into a space-time two-way multi-channel energy-informational conductor. Such an opportunity is available to a limited number of human beings who can use it only in their narrow circle and only for receiving and transmitting information related to the special assignments of Time. In this case, the media conductor ceases to perform its functions and begins to fully and completely reflect Time, which allows conscious human beings to work with it as a receiver and transmitter of information located in any part of the crystal of Time, or directed to any part of the crystal of Time. For sufficiently conscious beings, along with the ability to transmit information in space, it becomes possible to transmit information in time, namely to send it to the past, to the future and create programmable processes that will transmit information in the future or the past at any required time. For such work, they absolutely do not need to pay attention to what is happening on the screen, moreover, some of them can perform such manipulations even with the TV turned off. In principle, to create a spatio-temporal two-sided multichannel energy-information conductor, it is enough to have a simple window or door frame, or an arch, passage or opening. The Spider had just such an opening.
What the Spider could see through its opening between the toilet railing and the floor was not limited to what was happening inside the room. Due to his extreme degree of awareness, confirmed by the respect shown by the Poppy Dominion , which does not respect anyone who does not have a high level of self-awareness, the Spider could transform the opening at his disposal into a space-time two-way multi-channel energy-informational conductor. Anyone who has a sufficiently high level of self-awareness has information about the structure of the Time crystal. This knowledge, with a sufficient amount of practice and concentration, makes it possible to use the structure of the Time crystal for any of the substances and objects existing in our universe in order to transform them into something else. In this area of ​​temporary existence, an important role is played by the principle of equal exchange, which is a law and requires giving something equal in importance to the desired result.

***the Crystal***
Everything in the universe is a manifestation of time, which in its essence is a crystal. The illusion of separation of things, objects, processes, time periods and other well-known phenomena is a consequence of the separation of the human "I" into many false personalities. Each of these false personalities is a completely different human being, with completely different views and ideas. There may be some similarity in the manifestations of these personalities, but this is only in view of the fact that all personalities are inside one body of a human being. Therefore, for the uninitiated layman, one human being outwardly always represents one and the same person. In fact, almost every second of his life, a human being is not one, but different beings. That is why Poppy Dominion  is so detailed about the time that must be spent on work, and provides the most complete instructions and guidelines in the universe.
The presence of the idea of ​​the disunity of everything in the universe appears in the general presences of human beings due to the power of the illusion, which some of them, living on the continent of Asia in a country called India, call Maya. This power is the power of illusion generated by the universal mind. The single mind that Time has and that spreads throughout the universe is a consequence of the existence of information about everything in the universe. This mind is different from that of human beings. We can say that this is the Divine mind that processes and stores information about everything that exists in the universe. The fact that human beings do not possess all the properties inherent in this universal mind is a consequence of their scattered "I". Every human being who, after birth, forgets his true nature, begins to absorb information coming from the world around him, and takes it for truth. Together with this information, a human being accepts a large number of delusions, which often contradict each other, but due to their presence within the general presence of one human being, they take the forms of personalities that are different from each other and their views on the nature of reality. Further, the delusions of one human being combine with the delusions of others, allowing the power of illusion to arise and act in the presence of masses of human beings. This power can generate a variety of unimaginable pictures that appear to human beings as reality, but in fact are only a reflection of their thoughts inside a common crystal of time.
The crystal is the largest volumetric object in the universe, having the shape of an octagon at its base. This octagon consists of two solid hexagons closely adjacent to each other. By its nature, a crystal is information, but at different levels of organization of matter, it takes a form corresponding to this level. All levels are contained within one. The last of the levels available for human perception is the level of solar matter. At this stage, the crystal is a large light body in the shape of a three-dimensional hexagon. If you try to depict this crystal, you get three parallel hexagons, following one after the other, with connected vertices. This crystal contains information about all light interactions in the universe, but human beings can only perceive the consequences of these information processes. For human beings, the aforementioned effects appear as luminous phenomena and celestial bodies. At a lower level, the crystal begins to represent the same object with a hexagonal base, but not from pure solar matter, but from a very dense matter resembling a cut diamond in composition and quality. The higher the level of the crystal, the brighter it glows, and with a decrease in the level of energy and information saturation, the crystal glows less and less, but with a constant increase in density. That is why the fragments of the universal crystal of time, which can be found on Earth, do not contain light and do not emit it, but are simply dense transparent or translucent crystalline formations.
There is an evidence that a long time ago, during the time of civilizations known as Atlantis and Hyperborea, human beings possessed luminous crystals that emitted very harmonious sounds, more reminiscent of music than a simple sound. These singing crystals contained information about all the life activity of human beings that ever existed, all aspects of their presence, up to the fourth level, and information about everything that surrounded them. Such crystals were very valuable and were highly guarded by human beings, but after colossal catastrophes that occurred on planet Earth, there were no singing crystals available for new human beings. Perhaps today there is at least one of these crystals, but it is most likely contained in that room that has no restrictions in space, which is at the disposal of Time. Accordingly, no one except Time and possibly some representatives of the top of the Poppy Dominion  has access to this room. The use of this crystal would allow those who have access to it to acquire unlimited knowledge about everything that happened on the planet. Moreover, such a crystal would allow one to look into the most hidden corners of the souls of all human beings who have ever lived on the planet. Probably, it is precisely thanks to this opportunity that some members of the top of the Poppy Dominion  have a realized potential to organize a total suppression of human individuals and use these impersonal beings for their own purposes. It cannot be said with absolute certainty that this is the case, but all the available facts indicate that certain representatives of the top of the Poppy Dominion  have access to one of the singing crystals.

***the Web***
There were not only the two representatives of the human form of life mentioned above, in the room in which the Spider and the human beings were locked. In addition to these two, there were three more, of which two were constantly changing. Within almost three months, these two changed three times. They changed their skin color, weight, size and all external characteristics with the exception of gender. One human being, who did not enter into any relationship with the Spider and did not change his appearance, almost always slept. It has repeatedly stated that it prefers to stay in the Kingdom of Morpheus. It was hard to understand what exactly it meant, since no one met him in the opium storage room and he did not have this substance with him either. Perhaps this creature had an experience of using the final or intermediate product of the opium industry, or perhaps such an experience was destined for this creature in the future, which was definitely recorded within one of the levels of its general presence. There is no doubt that this creature received information from third-party sources not directly related to it. But whether it was conscious enough to analyze and process the information received remains a question. The fact that this creature received information from third-party sources is confirmed by the fact that the Spider and another conscious human being had the same information that it received some revelation in a dream or, as the sleeping creature put it, in the Kingdom of Morpheus. It is quite possible that this so-called revelation came from representatives of the Poppy Dominion  and was intended for those who were sufficiently aware to perceive and analyze it.
A voice from a dream voiced some provisions from the life of human beings and accompanied everything with quite colorful pictures that are definitely and unequivocally evoked in that area of ​​human nature that is responsible for the perception of intellectual information and thinking. It said: “A man is a machine. A person's knowledge of his machine is directly proportional to the collective knowledge of all people about all machines. Some people know more, others less, but in general, the knowledge of all people about everything in the world corresponds to the general level of development of all machines. The world of technology directly reflects the level of human knowledge or evolution. All technologies reflect this or that faculty of consciousness and prolong this or that function of the human body. The car is an improvement in the function of the legs, the excavator is the hands, the computer is the brain and intellect, the camera and the telescope are the eyes. The more a person studies himself, the more advanced technologies he can create and vice versa, the more he studies technologies, the more opportunities he has to know himself, and with the greatest number of perspectives he can work on himself. The inner world of a person, his knowledge of this world and the outside world, technologies, planets, stars and all other phenomena and knowledge about them are inextricably linked. Moreover, they constantly influence each other and are part of the same closed system.
Imagine a kiddie pool filled with plastic balls. Each ball touches several others, which, in turn, touch the next, those with the next, and so on. Thus, a connection is created within the entire pool. If you lightly touch one, then a certain number of other balls will also start moving, but not all. The energy applied to displace one ball will be extinguished and dissipated as it passes through the others. It won't be enough to affect the position of all the balls in the pool. And if a couple of children get into such a pool, they can turn the entire pool upside down. The child can be imagined as a larger ball - it has more energy and more capabilities in relation to the rest of the balls. By transferring some of its energy to one or more balls nearby, the larger ball can affect the entire pool. Each branch of human life should be designated with a ball with certain characteristics, presented as elements or smaller balls inside a large ball. It could be anything. The space inside the ball is a set of meanings and areas. One area is connected with another, that with the third, the third with the fourth, the fourth can be connected with the first and fifth, and the fifth with the second, sixth and seventh. The connections are not ordered, but together they make up what we imagine as life. Where there are connections between spheres of human life, the balls touch. So you can see that everything in life is connected, albeit not directly, but through a series of elements. If the number of elements inside one sphere grows, then it will condense to its maximum. Its mass will grow, the ball will fill, and then it will begin to grow in size, stretching its shell. So, if the number of elements inside one sphere begins to grow, for example, the number of chickens in a poultry farm, then at first the factory building will be completely filled. Then production will be improved and the largest number of workers will be hired, and then a new building will appear, which, in turn, will also be gradually filled, but only on the condition that there is a demand for chicken meat and eggs, which will give rise to the development of this type of industry. Such a process can be denoted in the form of compaction and growth of one ball in the pool, but this is possible only if other balls in the pool move or shrink, creating conditions for the growth of the ball in the poultry farm. If the ball compresses too quickly, then it may not grow, but only get heavier and sink to the bottom of the pool. Such a development of events is possible in the event that the number of workers at the poultry farm grows, but the amount of production is not. It is necessary to increase the volume of your influence so as not to sink to the bottom of the pool, since from there it is most difficult to influence other balls and the general condition of the pool.
It is important to study the behavior of the balls outside and the development of elements inside, then it will be possible to optimally organize your development. Knowing the course of development of all balls in the pool and their connection, one ball can take a better position and remove all obstacles in its path. Using this metaphor, one can easily explain why a person needs knowledge about the world around him and why it is better to study a large number of various spheres. Without knowing the inner nature, outer knowledge will be useless. Having knowledge of the external world, but not knowing anything about your nature, it will be impossible to predict development, since you will not know where to move and why. Knowing about the state of other balls in the pool allows you to track the influences and predict them every second, and inner knowledge allows you to know your reaction to them and control your state. Both the first and the second are important, since the person or his ball is part of the pool.
The condition of one of the balls in the pool depends entirely on the condition of the entire pool. The internal state of the ball reflects the state of the entire pool. Knowing the information about the state of one ball, you can find out the state of any of the balls in the pool. This comparison describes the state of affairs in people's lives and in any of their areas of activity. If a person knows his inner world well enough, then he can also learn the world around him. All parts of the human body are reflected in the external activities of all people. Agriculture can be attributed to digestion as it feeds this function. The sphere of public catering can also be compared with this function. But agriculture and public catering carry not only the functions of digestion, but also blood circulation, nervous system and others. The reflection of the nervous system can be thought of as the Internet, which today is definitely and ubiquitous used in agriculture and public catering. Previously, the reflection of the functions of the nervous system associated with responding to external stimuli and sending information to the brain center was associated with the media, telephone, television and special services. These structures spread throughout the planet and react to everything that happens on its surface and beyond. This situation testifies to the mutual penetration of all spheres of activity and their interaction, which exactly reflects the situation inside the human body. How it works inside, you can easily observe outside. Accordingly, one cannot neglect this or that form of knowledge, but it is necessary to study both the inner world and external processes.
The general state of the organisms of all people is reflected in the state of all spheres of human life. In different areas, the state of the organisms of different people will be different. Nevertheless, everything is balanced, although it is not uncommon for this or that area to weaken or undergo hypertrophied activation. "
The Spider and a conscious human being deeply respected the reception of this kind of information, since it exactly corresponded to their knowledge of the nature of things and once again confirmed the truth of their path. For that human being who has established relations with the Spider, the above revelation was of particular value, since it clarified the nature of the change in the external appearance of the unconscious human beings around him. If you imagine each human being and the Spider in the form of touching balls inside the room, then the metamorphoses with the appearance of some human beings become understandable. Prolonged meditation, work on oneself and the use of opium caused changes inside the human being that affected the state of his ball, which affected the state of the entire chamber. The balls of the other two human beings were dense enough to retain their familiar appearance. The same creature that was constantly asleep did not change its appearance, since it was less present in this reality and did not experience the described influences on itself. And the Spider's ball was even much larger than human balls, since, despite its small size, the Spider belonged to a very large family from the insect kingdom and was in direct energetic and informational communication with its relatives, which made its energy body much larger than its physical sizes. The balls of the other two human beings present in the room were light and loose, which, when the state of one of the balls inside the room changed, made them change externally and internally. That is why these human beings changed their height, weight, skin color, mood and everything else that they had. Despite the apparent separation of beings, objects and phenomena, there is a connection between everything in the universe, which is sometimes compared to a crystal lattice that holds atoms in a strictly defined form.
All human and living beings are connected. Between some creatures, the connection is stronger, between some weaker, but it is present, like a thin spider web. So the Spider was in a very close relationship with his relatives, which is definitely connected with the correct upbringing and the corresponding development of his consciousness. Such strong relationships are accompanied by love and compassion for their neighbors, which contributes to the development of the energy body of all individuals in communication. Therefore, if you look at the Spider not as an insect, but as a ball in the common pool of the universe, then its ball will be one of the largest, only, probably, a ball of opium and a common ball of time, which includes all other balls, will be larger than it. The fact that the Spider possesses the characteristics attributed to it is confirmed by nothing more than the presence of knowledge of weaving a web within its general presence. The network, which is the same universal display of time, like a crystal with a hexagon at its base, is present in all phenomena and processes, but not every living being knows about its existence. Many animals, in addition to the spider, are aware of the existence of the network, this is confirmed by their ability to navigate along the magnetic lines of the Earth, which is another manifestation of the universal network. Human beings, for the most part, know about the fishing net, about the network of wires and the Internet, few of them know about the network of magnetic lines around the planet and the network of meridians inside the body of a human being. Some of them know that a spider weaves a net, and that some birds have a net in their beaks for catching insects. But a very small number of human beings are aware of the fact that the network is a general and all-encompassing manifestation of time, which plays one of the most important roles in the life of everything in the universe.
Planets and stars connected by a network of magnetic influences are dependent on each other. These influences contain information about all changes in the universe, which is another information network. Passing through the stars and planets, influences enter the world of human and other living beings, which makes the latter feel changes within their common presences. Further, these influences pass to the satellites of the planets and inside the densest layers to physical crystals. Having obtained one of the crystals, you can easily observe all the influences in the universe, but for this you need to have consciousness and deep respect for the representative of the mineral kingdom. Otherwise, you may not learn anything and even ruin the life of yourself and those around you. Information on how to establish interactions with minerals, as well as many other things, is kept secret by the Poppy Dominion . Mainly because the mineral particles serve as food for the opium-producing red flowers. And if you strongly influence the state of one or another mineral layer, then the quality of the final and intermediate products of the opium industry can undergo serious changes, which is extremely unprofitable and costly. Influences, passing from the uppermost layers of the common crystal of time, end their existence in the lower and densest worlds, in which all interactions are subject to a huge number of laws, which makes them very complex and long. The bottom and the top, like everything in the universe, are inextricably linked, but there is also a network that connects all the elements at each individual level.
If you look at the flower, you can see the root system, stem, petals and bud. Each of these parts of the plant reflects a certain level of matter. They are all interconnected, but each of them interacts with the outside world in its own way. The roots feed from the ground, the stem carries substances inside the plant, the petals receive sunlight and produce oxygen, and the bud protects itself for reproduction and something else. This is something, there is nothing more than interaction at the level of impressions. The substance that has such a tremendous influence on human beings is produced by this simple device for taking three kinds of food, but only the last and most subtle kind of food, namely the impression, plays the most important role here. If the picker treats flowers poorly and does his job poorly, then the product is of poor quality. If he forgets about the flowers, then they bloom, which leads to their reproduction, but not to the production of opium. It is the attitude of a human being that is conveyed to flowers that largely influences the quality of the final or intermediate product of the opium industry. It's like raising children. If they are not given the right attitude, then they begin to rot at heart. If we forget about them and their upbringing, then they begin to bloom like flowers and not give society the most necessary substance for its existence - opium.
The network that connects everything in the universe has long been under control, and the Poppy Dominion  has long made sure that trained human beings are specially bred to work in the poppy fields.

***the Knife***
The way Spider met individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion  deserves special attention in the vein of this story. This information was communicated to a conscious human being at the moment when it wondered for a moment how the Spider intended to receive opium. Along with the information about the space-time portal teleportation, the Spider transmitted to the human being brief information about the nature of his acquaintance with the galactic producers and suppliers of opium. Perhaps he did this in connection with the generally accepted norms of decency, which imply the introduction of new participants in the conversation, or because he did not want a human being to puzzle himself over guessing where he got such serious acquaintances, or maybe just because it was in his mood. In any case, the Spider made it clear to a human being that he and his entire family from time immemorial know the most influential individuals in all spheres of the community of human beings from planet Earth, and all these influential individuals, in turn, know his family. We can say that his family is a kind of clan that has influence and is universally respected. In addition to the most influential human beings in all known and unknown industries, the Spider Clan has the most widespread network of acquaintances with all layers and varieties of human and other living beings. The spider did not convey how it happened, but absolutely everyone, from young children to decrepit old people, knows about the existence of the Spider Clan.
In ancient times, respect was achieved through a series of professional and brutal killings of all those who tried to resist the Clan's policies. It was the policy of Poppy Dominion , based on poison, hypnosis and total suppression of human individuality. The main weapon from those times and until now has been and remains a poisoned, sharply sharpened knife, symbolizing nothing more than a spider bite. Naturally, only human beings have this knife, since no real spider needs one, because it has an original bite and original poison. Over time, the Clan stopped killing in large quantities and moved from physical poison to emotional and psychological poison. It was these forms of poisons that allowed the Clan's influence to spread throughout. The new poison was developed in monasteries, which were like fortresses for training recruited adepts. Of course, the training was based on the total suppression of human individuality and the further unconditional fulfillment of all kinds of tasks and assignments by the adepts. This nature of learning, again, originates from the characteristics of the spider organism. The action of spider venom often paralyzes the victim before its death. In the same way, the action of the psychological and emotional poison, which later came to be called "Opium for the people" or religion, completely paralyzes the corresponding functions of the human being. Penetrating into the general presence of a creature, like a sharp knife, certain forms of information in combination with certain substances produce an effect that subsequently makes a human being completely controllable to the one who applied this type of influence. As a result, the brain, heart and body belong entirely to the Spider. Moreover, they literally belong to the Spider, since none of the followers of the Spider Clan, except for real spiders from the insect kingdom, has an integral and indivisible "I", despite all their superpowers, capabilities and level of influence.
Power within the Clan is built on a hierarchical ladder, at the top of which is one of the representatives of the Spider family. All others in the Clan perform functions transmitted through the internal energy and information network, purely mechanically and unconsciously. To date, there is no evidence that someone was able to completely free themselves from the total control of this ancient and influential Clan. But there is a lot of evidence of the most brutal killings and disappearances of human beings of various levels, which are in one way or another with the Spider Clan or the Poppy Dominion . Such connections are not accidental, because the Spider Clan was initially focused only on killing in order to ensure its existence and gain power, and the Poppy Dominion  always needed serious force support to ensure the safety of their plantations and trade. Moreover, after a rather short joint work of these Structures, it was found that under a certain set of circumstances, opium has the same effect as spider venom, and spider venom has the same effect as opium. And in order to consume the end product of the opium industry, it is necessary to use a needle piercing the skin, which is very much like a spider bite. Upon closer examination of these processes, the two organizations discovered in their past kinship ties that were rooted in Time. After that, the work began to be structured in a completely different way, and it was during this period of time that the expression "Opium for the people" appeared.
This name was not chosen by chance, moreover, it was developed over the years. Few could have guessed that one day all human beings on the planet inhabited by them would believe in the final or intermediate product of the opium industry. At first glance, this is a metaphorical name created in laboratories for the religion and belief of most human beings, in fact there is something more and has a much deeper and more serious meaning. Opium for the people is not just a belief in the fact that the final or intermediate product of the opium industry can somehow affect the mental and physical state of a person, but in essence it is a direct transmission of the mechanism of action of religious teachings. The thing is that certain representatives of the Poppy Dominion  and the Spider Clan, after a detailed and long analysis of the work of their organizations, found a deep similarity between the way they work. Realizing this, they saw that their type of work is universal, that is, it contains all the elements of all other types of activity existing in the universe. Beginning to study different types of work and types of organizations, certain representatives of the Poppy Dominion  and the Spider Clan discovered that the principle of operation of any outside organization or a single human being always carries the principle of opium production or weaving a web. After that, it was decided to create a certain artificial formation that would replace some faculties of human nature and would allow directly or through some media to completely and completely control the activities of human beings. Subsequently, this formation began to be called religion, but the expression "Opium for the people" existed even before the emergence of this concept. The Spider clan chose not to advertise their participation in the creation of such a formation, since any connections of religion with such an organization could immediately alienate new adherents from relations with it. Therefore, the religion was called "Opium for the people" and not "Poison for the people" or "Poisonous knife for the people." Thanks to this invention, the influence of the Spider Clan and Poppy Dominion  became unlimited and their methods, although they did not completely deviate from the most brutal murders, but significantly reduced their number. After the emergence of a religion based on the principle of action of opium or spider venom, not only the influence of these organizations increased, but it was also possible to almost completely hide information about their existence.

***the Milk & Chocolate***
The joint work of the two organizations was so effective, and the relationship between the representatives of these organizations was so strong that at the highest level it was decided not to limit joint activities and not to put any restrictions on the work. After major advances were made in religion and military strategy, the Spider Clan and the Poppy Dominion  made a highly successful attempt to extend their control into all other spheres of human activity and their branches of life. Considering the fact that the opium trade since time immemorial and contract killings amassed enormous capital for these organizations, the Poppy Dominion  and the Spider Clan had the opportunity to infiltrate any organization existing in the universe and gradually absorb it. Organizations began their spread with industries, the end or intermediate product of which were substances that produce an effect on human beings similar to the effect of using opium, but, of course, less significant. Such substances are tobacco, hemp, tea, cocaine, cocoa, coffee, and sugar. Partly clothing, and accordingly the production of fabrics. Weapons and everything related to them. Carbonated drinks, alcohol, jewelry, videos and gambling and everything that causes vivid positive emotions and strong physical or mental dependence.
A principle was developed that made it possible to most effectively induce dependence within the presence of human beings in relation to the products they consume. Initially, small doses of heroin, cocaine and other drugs were added to some commodities. This made it possible to significantly increase the amount of received positive emotions, as well as to form addiction. Subsequently, human beings began to use products with heroin and cocaine in quantities comparable to the pure use of the final or intermediate products of the opium and cocaine industries. For your information, the cocaine industry is one of the closest reflections of the opium industry and is subject to all the same laws as its prototype. It is also under the control of individual members of the Poppy Dominion , only these have become better known as the cocaine barons. In addition to the cocaine industry, there are many types of plant-derived drug production. All of this is a reflection of a single matrix called the opium industry. It goes without saying that all types of drug production from plants are under the control of the Poppy Dominion , despite its external innocence. But back to products that, at first glance, should not contain drugs at all, but simply contribute to the production of happiness hormones within human organisms.
These products are sweets and their quintessence is sugar. Wherever sugar is found, there is a direct or indirect analogy with opiates. Most human beings on planet Earth adore sweet foods and cannot even imagine their life without eating them. The thing is that sweets at one time received a good promotion with the support of the Poppy Dominion . After human beings literally began to die from the use of sweet products containing some dose of heroin, it was decided to replace the final product of the opium industry with its transcendental counterpart, that is, advertising. The effect produced by the final or intermediate product of the opium industry on an individual human being has been thoroughly studied and translated from the level of physical impact to the level of emotional and intellectual. In other words, the chemical reaction, caused within the general presence of a human being by the final or intermediate product of the opium industry, began to be caused there by means of energetic and informational influence. This method of influencing the general presence of a human being was discovered quite a long time ago, but has become widely used relatively recently. Initially, this method was possible due to the wave nature of all manifestations in the universe. If we take into account that during the course of a chemical reaction caused by the effect of an opiate on the human body, the latter begins to emit a wave of a certain frequency, then breaking the wave into three parts and simulating it by means of spatial oscillators can cause the necessary effect without the use of physical opium. Moreover, additional research by Poppy Dominion  in the field of control over human beings made it possible to replace spatial oscillators with ordinary gestalts. Letters, symbols and shapes began to fulfill this function. Based on these studies, Poppy Dominion , after the seizure of one or another type of industry, began to place its gestalts on the packaging of its products. This way of forming dependence within the general presence of human beings was called branding, and the science, which later began to study the phenomena of branding, came to be called marketing. But in fact, these are two more delusions of some human beings who do not possess even a grain of knowledge about the Crystal of Time.
It is not possible to study any form of improving the perception of packaging of different products for human beings. There is no way to come up with something new in this area. The point is that the so-called “branding” is always only the placement of the energy-informational form of opium, presented in the form of a gestalt, on the packaging of this or that product. And as mentioned earlier, all information regarding the study of the effects of opium on the general presence of human beings is kept in the strictest confidence by the Poppy Dominion . There is no way to investigate anything related to opium without direct contact with this supra-planetary formation, which necessarily destroys any manifestation of human individuality without the slightest chance of salvation. Accordingly, all those human beings who call themselves marketers, advertisers, branding specialists, media ecologists and simply modern scientists, in fact, are workers in the opium industry, every second of their lives acting according to the most precise instructions in the world. And there is no hope that Poppy Dominion  does not force them to specifically disseminate information about heroin-like phenomena in all kinds of branches of human life. There is no doubt that all the colossal in scale and cost activity developed around the promotion of new types of chocolate and milk in the world of human beings is one of the clearly planned and controlled stages in the spread of the influence of Poppy Dominion .

***the Airplane***


Jet turbines, one of the latest types of engines developed by human beings for movement through the air and in space, emit a sound that, when an aircraft called an airplane overcomes the speed of sound, reaches the ears of some human beings, but only after a certain time has elapsed since the moment when the plane itself has already flown this point in space. This interesting phenomenon had something to do with the spatial oscillators used by Poppy Dominion  before ordinary gestalts had come into play. It would be more accurate to say that this phenomenon has to do with space-time oscillators, which were also used by the Poppy Dominion . But this information is kept in a much tighter secret than that of the spatial oscillators used to form addiction within the general presence of human beings without consuming the final or intermediate product of the opium industry in a physical way, although this latter information is kept in secret in the strictest possible way.

The thing is that the space-time oscillator makes it possible to apply a wave to a human being, forming within his general presence an effect similar to that produced by the use of one of the forms of opium in the past or in the future. Thanks to this method of influence, it becomes possible to keep masses of human beings in a state of heroin intoxication all their lives from their very birth with the strongest dependence on the drug in question. Moreover, almost all beings on planet Earth, with the exception of those who have a holistic and indivisible "I", or a formed desire to acquire a holistic and indivisible "I", or those who were not subject to the negative influence of civilization and developed in natural conditions with the right education, have long been workers in one of the branches and reflections of the opium industry. This happened due to the fact that after the discovery of the possibility of using space-time oscillators, and they were discovered even before the times of ancient Egypt, the Poppy Dominion, having launched them once, did not turn them off even once until the start of using ordinary gestalts. And then, with the beginning of the use of ordinary gestalts, the Poppy Dominion  turned off the space-time oscillators, which form an effect similar to that produced by the physical use of the final or intermediate products of the opium industry, only in order to test the effect produced by ordinary gestalts, regardless of the effects produced by mentioned oscillators. The only catch with the use of space-time oscillators was that because they were on all the time, human beings not only lost any possibility of gaining individuality, but they also lost the ability to exist normally without the opium effect wave generators turned on. Laziness-prone human beings, forced to live every second of their lives in accordance with the instructions and devote their entire lives to work, were so accustomed to experiencing a certain effect within their general presence that this feature of the influence of the space-time oscillator was copied onto everything else that these people did. Unlucky creatures. In other words, as soon as they experienced the sensations of performing some new action, they could no longer imagine their life without this sensation and included the action that generated the new effect into their daily routine, which, of course, went against the instructions. After a certain dose of radiation, equal to approximately twenty-one years of the life of a human being, it began to load its life with all kinds of actions that it considered obligatory to perform, since it could not even imagine living for even a second without the opportunity to experience a certain effect. This situation significantly worsened the state of affairs associated with the production and distribution of the final or intermediate product of the opium industry, more final than intermediate.

The notorious peculiarity of the sound from jet turbines of an aircraft reaching the ear of a human being after the aircraft has overcome that point in space where the ear was, is reflected in nothing else than, in particular, spatio-temporal oscillators to convey to a human being a critical degree of exposure after twenty-one year of the life of the latter under the influence of radiation. By sending waves into the past of a human being, regardless of age, the space-time oscillator makes that being dependent and controlled from the moment of his birth, and over the next one year and twenty years, the human being reaches a critical point of exposure. But the effect that the critical point produces exists within the general presence of a human being from the moment when he is actually twenty-one years old from his birth. In other words, if a human being falls under the influence of a space-time oscillator at the age of thirty-three, then in fact his whole life changes, undergoing space-time distortions from the very moment of his birth, and at fifty-four years he will already be considered living with the consequences of perception critical degree of exposure from the age of twenty-one, which makes his whole life after the turn of twenty-one years, which is thirty-three years, absolutely useless in the space-time continuum in relation to opium production. Therefore, most likely such a person will die at fifty-four years old, at most fifty-five years old, since he will be an unnecessary ballast for Poppy Dominion.

From the point of view of an ordinary layman, there is no way to prevent the radiation of the space-time oscillator and somehow protect himself from them, just as there is no way to see an airplane, the sound from which jet turbines he just heard. Since by the time the head rises to look at the sky, the plane will already have overcome several hundred kilometers at a speed exceeding the speed of sound propagation in space and will disappear from sight.

***the Train***

At the very moment when a sound travels the distance from the turbine of an airplane to the ear of one of the human beings, another sound from the clatter of the wheels of a train produces a completely different effect, yet in exactly the same way reaches perhaps the same ear. The first generates within the presence of a human being the desire to raise the head and see where the source of such a loud vibration is. The second encourages a person to think and to close his eyes and see what is happening inside the inner world. The frequency, amplitude and duration of vibrations, when changing, cause the ear to perceive them as different sounds. Also, substances consisting of atoms with different numbers of electrons, protons and neutrons make a human being see and feel matter as consisting of different substances and having different qualities. If a human being did not perceive all these, at first glance, fundamental differences between waves and atoms, then all sounds, colors, types of matter and phenomena would simply not exist, and everything would be a single monolith. So, for example, if you place a human being in water, and then, after freezing it, place the resulting crystal in a dark and silent room, then the human being will cease to distinguish anything. Naturally, provided that the same temperature, humidity and other parameters are maintained. In such a state, there is no way to say that anything exists at all except for the thoughts and emotions derived from those thoughts and emotions themselves. There is a possibility that for some time the body of a human being will still receive sensations from the ice, but soon it, together with the brain, will either go into a state of suspended animation or die from hypothermia.

Being in the same room with the Spider, human beings were not frozen, but it can be said that they definitely experienced some limitations in their perception of the world around them. So, for example, the Spider, staying almost all his time in a space fenced with wooden plywood, could not see absolutely everything that was in the described room. Of course, he was aware of everything and everyone who was there. And everything that could be known about it was in his awareness as well. The Spider received this information not in the way that human and other living beings usually do. In other words, the Spider did not see or touch, and also did not smell or hear anything that was in his room, but used the ability of his general presence to perceive the atmosphere or astral energy of objects and beings that were near him or even at a considerable distance. Possessing the ability to so-called telepathy, the Spider could perceive and send information through space. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, his capabilities were not constrained by time, which meant that he could move inside the common mental body of the planet, and maybe even the solar system and even the entire universe in absolutely any time direction. He did it just like a man walking on a moving train. Passing from one unit of time to another, as from one compartment to another, the Spider could see absolutely everything that was in each compartment, in the corridor, and even look out the window.

The train, as an object that perfectly reflects the nature of individual sections of the common Time Crystal, is nothing more than a mental body moving in the time continuum. The general mental body is divided into sections, which are presented in the form of wagons, and each wagon is divided into compartments, which are divided by the number of sleeping or seating places. Each sleeping or seating place is divided into what it consists of, namely, the design and material from which it is made. The design, in turn, is divided into elements that are the basis or frame, auxiliary parts and fasteners. The material is divided by how it was made, such as the type of weave or the type of rubber used. And all these elements are again divided into atoms and molecules, which are divided into elementary and simple particles. So the train conveys the law of manifestation of the structure of octaves in the most remarkable way, and there is no need in this context to say that this law is manifested in everything in the universe, from small to large. After all, if it exists, it would seem, in such a purely social structure as a train, which once personified the progress and movement of the thoughts of human beings, and is now widely used for spatial movement, then the law of octave definitely exists in everything else that has no the slightest relation to the activity of human beings. Although, again, it cannot be said that there is at least something in the entire universe that does not have the slightest relation to the activity of these beings, rather, everything that is there is precisely this activity, since the latter is dependent on the surrounding world and is influenced by it. Accordingly, everything that was in the room was in connection with the Spider, which allowed him to freely examine and study it. But since the Spider was not a human being, his activity was not dependent on the world around him. Though, all human beings in the room experienced these influences. Moreover, the fact that they ended up being locked in the same room with the Spider is a consequence of the fact that their activity was influenced by the outside world. All of them, except perhaps one, the most conscious human being, truly wanted to get out of this room as soon as possible, but did not have any opportunity to do so. Only that conscious human being did not have a critical desire to get out of this room as soon as possible. Most likely, such indifference was due to the fact that it deliberately did not distinguish between all manifestations of a single and common Time Crystal.

***the Buttons***

The hexagon underlying the overall Time Crystal has some amazing properties, provided that all its sides and angles are equal. Such a hexagon can be inscribed in a circle and all its vertices will lie on the boundary of this circle. In order to determine exactly where the vertices of the hexagon will be, it is necessary to fill the large circle with smaller ones that have half the radius. These smaller circles should be adjacent to the border of the large circle, and the vertices of the hexagon will be located at the points of their contact. If we continue the process of inscribing smaller circles into larger ones, then it will be possible to fill one large hexagon with smaller ones that are directly proportional to each other. This phenomenon reflects the presence of the golden section in this design. And the fact that the hexagon is the basis of the common Crystal of Time, allows to reflect its nature in the drawing of everything that exists in the universe, with its correct construction. The design of circles and connections of their intersections and points of contact in ancient times was called the flower of life.

A circle, like a hexagon, can have a three-dimensional shape. To build it, you need to start rotating the selected figure around its axis. And if we take into account that all bodies in the time continuum are subject to rotation around their axis and this rotation is an integral part of their existence, then it becomes obvious that each body is nothing but a ball. It was this position about the nature of things that was conveyed in a dream to one of the sleeping human beings who were in the same room with the Spider. It is a pity that this creature could not take anything out of its dream except the dominating image of the ball. Another, conscious being, which, like the Spider, had the ability to perceive messages, transmitted in the presence of other beings through dreams, learnt a lot of useful information for itself. As noted earlier, this dream clarified the nature of why some of the creatures in the described room changed their shape, but this was not the only useful conclusion. Another useful conclusion was that the being was able to understand how reality is stitched together. Moreover, the term “stitched together” is used in the vein of this narrative not metaphorically, but literally.

Reality, which is a manifestation of the common Crystal of Time, is also the canvas or substance that makes up the common Crystal. This substance at different levels will be denser or coarser, depending on the density and saturation of information and energy. Somewhere the canvas will be very thin, soft, easily changing and allowing other substances and influences to pass through it, and somewhere it will be rough and dense, not amenable to change and not allowing other substances to pass through. Thermal conductivity, about which Spider knew so much, but did not advertise his knowledge, is one of the key properties that determine the level of saturation and density of a substance. If the air can easily pass anything through itself, since it is discharged, then the stone will pass through itself a limited amount of vibrations. On the other hand, the heat transmitted through the air will quickly disappear, splitting into many scattered vibrations, and the heat transmitted to the stone will linger in it for a long amount of time, only gradually fading away and passing into the atmosphere surrounding the stone.

Where there is a transfer of thermal energy from one substance to another, there is a so-called "seam" of reality. This seam is the point of contact of two balls, which in fact are all objects and substances in another dimension. For a better understanding of this provision, it is necessary to clarify what the concept of “dimension”  means as such. This is nothing but an environment that allows you to measure the processes occurring in it in certain and unique characteristics. It is the difference in the characteristics used to measure and categorize the processes occurring in different environments that forms the concept of the difference between different dimensions of reality. If you try to determine in which particular dimension all objects and phenomena are balls, then you need to look both deep into the structure of matter and into a global perspective. In other words, you must first explore the available dimensions, relative to the scale taken as a constant or ideal. If you look at all phenomena and processes from the perspective of a human being, then you can choose the average statistical size of his body as a unit of measurement or a constant. In this dimension, it is hard to notice the fact that everything is indeed touching and interpenetrating spheres. If we take an atom as a unit of measurement, then we can easily see that all phenomena and processes consist of a colossal number of tiny balls attracted to each other with an incredible force for such a small size. Similarly, if one of the Suns or one of the planets is taken as a unit of measurement, then one can also notice that at this level everything is the interaction of balls of a fairly impressive size and in colossal quantities. How to notice the identical nature at the level where the average size of the body of a human being was chosen as a constant? To do this, it is necessary to add to the usual characteristics of the size and quality of substances and objects one more, which is usually attributed to time. Namely, objects and phenomena should be compared not only with respect to their physical qualities, but also with respect to the extent of their existence in the time continuum. If you look at one person not as a physical body, but as a combination of actions, emotions, thoughts and body, and also keep track of all the actions he committed, emotions experienced and existing within his general presence of thought, then you get something more than just a physical body. 

Moreover, the human being will cease to be what we usually imagine him to be. In this vein, it becomes a matrix with a certain number of variables. Its interactions with the surrounding world are also expressed in the form of interaction of matrices, but only in the form of one small matrix of the entire universe inside the common matrix. In order to trace the changes in the state of a human being, it is necessary to bring together and consistently present all the changes in its matrix. This can be done by representing the matrices as a chain of successive sets. And only when all the matrices are brought together, it will be possible to start moving in time and track the interactions of the balls of all processes in this dimension. It is necessary to have a sufficiently high degree of consciousness in order to be able to look at the overall picture of all things and processes with an extension in time and at the same time be able to descend to one of the states of one specific matrix and fully experience it for yourself. Such a fairly high level of self-consciousness is possessed by some individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion and the Clan of the Spider, and, of course, the Time. There are also other living beings and organizations that have a similar level of consciousness, but they have not acquired a sufficient degree of fame and therefore are not represented here.

The spider, weaving the web, forms a matrix that delays time and forces everyone caught in this web to experience the stoppage of Time. The effect of falling into a spider web is comparable to the effect of freezing in a cryogenic chamber. It goes without saying that before eating its prey, the spider bites it in order to paralyze it. His web is nothing but a kind of black hole, inside which distortions occur. To an outsider, the web may not be anything interesting except for its bizarre shape and high-quality construction. But besides these qualities, the spider web carries a much deeper meaning. The ball, which represents the Spider in another dimension, contains many sublevels within itself, which are also expressed by balls. At each individual moment of time, the ball is a circle or a set, reflecting the state of the being at that moment. The web is just the same as a reflection of the general state of the Spider at a particular point in time. But in view of the fact that it is manifested as a structure that delays Time, the ball is not formed, and even in another dimension it does not change, which causes a living being caught in the web to experience the stoppage of time. It can be said that the Spider intentionally stops Time, and that this ability allows him to be beyond the laws that govern the life of human beings. And any human being, in turn, also has a web, or rather a network around his body, the relation of which to the body of a human being is much less than the relation of the Spider's network to his body. Also, the network of a human being does not have the ability to delay Time and stop it for everyone who enters this network. Such a network for a human being is the aura or atmosphere, his energy field. As a rule, it is poorly developed and does not have a good structure inside. The aura of the Spider is much stronger and is expressed in the form of a web, which indicates the presence of a well-formed and densely shaped structure inside its energy body.

The phenomenon of stopping Time inside the space occupied by a spider web is generated by using a special method of stitching reality. The spider, in order to make Time stop in another dimension and transfer this phenomenon to a dimension accessible to most living beings, uses buttons. And these are not some abstract metaphorical objects that fasten one layer of energy to another, forcing them to mix, which causes distortions in space and, as a result, in time. These are the most ordinary buttons that human beings use to fasten their clothes. The fact is that the buttons are nothing more than another wonderful manifestation of the common Time Crystal. This phenomenon was developed by the Poppy Dominion  so that human beings could fasten pieces of matter to their physical body and not experience inconvenience as to how to remove this matter later. Subsequently, buttons were ubiquitous in all activities of human beings. Moreover, they acquired such a variety of shapes, sizes and colors that they sometimes began to turn into luxury items. Accordingly, buttons began to reflect the social status of a person over time. For example, the golden buttons on the general's tunic testified and still testify to the excellent state of affairs of this general. Although, this seemingly distinctive sign does not carry any explanation of how this general will wage war, namely, successfully or not. In addition to such a pronounced difference, buttons began to reflect some of the secret differences between the status and position of individual human beings.

Sometimes some combination of buttons on the sleeve of a jacket or coat, and a button of a particular shape or color in a certain place on a garment, may indicate the affiliation of a given human being who wears it to some organization, and may even play the role of an indicator of the position and functions in this organization. Such widespread misuse of buttons has given them a certain amount of energy and even more information, which has made them an object of a metaphysical nature to the intellect of human beings. A button that fastens a piece of matter in the same way fastens a person to a certain organization. This possibility of a hidden meaning, seemingly the simplest, at first glance, the object creates a certain aura around those buttons that really play the role of transcendental stitchers. The same buttons that Spider used were sewn onto the costumes of the members of the Spider Clan in the same way. These buttons sometimes have a tremendous impact on the adherents of the Clan, as they indicate the highest positions in this organization. And everyone knows that the leaders of the Clan have direct contact with representatives of the insect kingdom, more precisely, with real spiders, and possibly even with individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion. Such connection of the leadership of the Clan Spider, undoubtedly, brings the older adepts of the Clan closer to the Time in the eyes of the new ones. Accordingly, sometimes young adepts experience an effect similar to that obtained from the use of the final or intermediate products of the opium industry, seeing certain buttons and their combinations on the clothes of a passer-by. Experiencing a colossal outburst of emotions, young adepts direct all this energy with their thoughts to Time. Referring her to either the Poppy Dominion  or directly to real spiders. Adepts direct energy through buttons, which serve as a kind of matrix or formula for storing information and energy. Individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion  or spiders can read the information contained in it and pump out the required amount of energy by referring to one of these matrices in a parallel dimension. Further, a spider or an individual representative of the Poppy Dominion  can use the received energy and information to create a portal, oscillator, telepathic message, or a web that will stop time and thereby reflect the black hole to some extent.

PART 2 - PASSIVE POWER
***the Dove***

The most perfect and unsurpassed container for moving through the air was and remains the dove bird. This bird will easily give odds to any modern fighter jet and a spacecraft as well. The fact that a fighter jet and a spacecraft can reach much greater speeds than a pigeon, and also carry people and valuable cargo, does not play any significant role, since the human beings who created these devices and use them do not possess a holistic and indivisible "I". This not insignificant fact makes all the machines moving in space as useless as the lives of those who move in them. The creator and the creation are meaningless mechanical details of one general dynamic picture, observed through someone's frame. The dove, in turn, is very close to the Time and has a clear and orderly behavioral line, which indicates the presence of Consciousness in this individual, even if not in each.

Mechanicalness in the manifestations of the activity of human beings often leads to their death. The deplorable result of a life that is not entirely justified can be overtaken by one of the unconscious living beings due to the fact that they do not control the situation. And also any human being subject to automatism can cause death to someone from the surrounding environment. Very often human beings kill animals, insects and birds because of their unconscious attitude towards life. It can be said that all the so-called murderers that commit the act of the crime agree that it brings mostly negative emotions. And in reality, unconscious murder does not represent any significant interest for them. They do it because there is such a possibility, and the lack of control of the situation by human beings realizes this possibility.

Some creatures in the Spider's room for a short period of time acquired the desire to kill this insect. Of course, the Spider was also a killer, but in his case it was justified by his nature. One smarter and more developed insect creates the conditions in order to devour some others. Thus, a certain balance is maintained within its overall presence. But what would human beings get if they could still kill this spider? Absolutely they would not have received anything, and maybe they would have acquired some problems. Some living beings are immune to killing. They cannot be killed, because they have quite serious patronage and in the event of their death, the killer will suffer, obviously not unreasonably. There is no need to mention who the Spider was and what would have happened to those human beings who wanted to destroy him. And there is no need to cover this issue also because they would never have succeeded. The spider, sensing the incipient tendency to his death, immediately prevented it by transmitting the appropriate energy impulse to those human beings who had compassion for him. Given this impulse, these companions of the Spider prevented the unconscious attempts of other living beings to kill the insect.

The possibility of inflicting death on other living beings and on oneself remains not fully explored by these human organisms, but it is fully explored by the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan. Death comes as a result of the Time always and absolutely precisely. There is no doubt about this, because in general everything happens because of the Time. But this position is available for comprehensive understanding and experience only to those who have a sufficient degree of awareness and possess the knowledge that the Time is the single and common Crystal. Everyone else is forced to delve into the details of the nature of time, its distribution and influence. To do this, one can imagine that in order to accomplish a certain event, there is always a start or beginning of something. Naturally, there is no start, and all events are predetermined by circumstances that have been brewing from the very beginning of the existence of everything, which also essentially never happened. It is very difficult for logical understanding. 

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that every event has its beginning. This beginning is born in the highest layers of our universe, where none of the human beings can detect matter. Nevertheless, matter exists everywhere, but we can perceive some part of it, or rather most of it, only as a consequence of its presence, and it is customary to call it information itself. This information, which human beings are accustomed to consider as a product of the activity of their intellect, actually has a physical component. In this context, there is no need to delve into the process in which the smallest particles of a dual nature, namely, consisting of a physical carrier and an ultra-thin magnetic field, contain the entirety of information about their nature, expressed in the form of vibrations with different frequencies and phases. 

Each of the vibrations present in the magnetic field of one of the smallest particles that make up our reality is an analogue of what human beings used to call the alphabet. Letters or symbols and hieroglyphs used by human beings to convey information are also expressions of vibrations with different characteristics, but an explanation of all this is not necessary in this context. The only thing that matters is that some fragments of the common Crystal of Time contain the start of certain events and phenomena, which often lead to the death of living beings. These beginnings exist in the form of a potential possibility of accomplishing this or that event. Such a possibility is controlled by the laws that operate at the level of existence of these principles, and as it acquires a more substantial material carrier, it is either realized or transformed into something else. During the acquisition of a denser material carrier, the possibility also acquires the influence of various laws that operate at denser levels. These laws determine its further development and make the possibility of this or that event positive for predestination and prevention. Of course, such a view of where death comes from to seemingly completely innocent and undeserving of such an end living beings remains a mystery to many of them. Moreover, human beings, due to their strange way of thinking, are prone to fantasy and often attribute supernatural and even mystical principles to death. In fact, death occurs due to poor control over the situation and the inability to influence it in any way.

To ensure that human beings selected to work in the poppy fields and other areas of the opium industry do not die for nothing, the Poppy Dominion makes for them personal and detailed instructions for spending every second of the rest of their lives. Such instructions not only contain descriptions of everything that they will have to do, but also instructions on when to do it. They also have inside them a list of non-standard and unexpected situations that may arise during work and explanations of what needs to be done in such cases. Of course, all non-standard situations are calculated in advance by Poppy Dominion and are included in the work schedule of human beings with a distinctive mark. Due to the fact that the vast majority of human beings do not have the opportunity to memorize at least a hundredth of such an instruction by heart, and it takes too much time to refer to the instruction during work, Poppy Dominion began to load instructions into the common presences of human beings through dreams. These instructions, after their complete transfer from one special section of the common Crystal of Time into the presences of human beings, remain there as stimulating impulses, blocks of thoughts and involuntary instincts. After a human being who has been confronted with the red poppy or the end or intermediate product of the opium industry has received complete instruction during sleep for the rest of its life, it is considered ready for work and immediately starts working on waking. It does not bother how it knows what it needs to do and why. It has answers to all its own and other people's questions, as well as an appropriate behavior pattern, habits and, of course, instincts that will make it behave correctly in the so-called non-standard and emergency situations. It can be said that such a human being will never wake up again, and he will not contain the memory that it woke up before, even if it actually managed to wake up from sleep at least once. Such creatures are ideal tools to achieve the goals of Poppy Dominion. They unconditionally, resignedly and immediately, as well as without unnecessary instructions, explanations and re-questions, do everything that they have to do.

It was just one of the instructions mentioned above that the human being who almost always slept in the Spider's room began to receive. The fact is that in view of the colossal amount of information contained in the instructions developed by Poppy Dominion, one sleep session is not always enough for their complete transmission. Moreover, sometimes there is not enough time spent in the "Kingdom of Morpheus" to get all the necessary information. But as soon as a human being falls asleep even after being exposed to poppy, opium or heroin, it becomes one of those who are sure to receive the entire instruction sooner or later. For the Poppy Dominion, this is a law that cannot be repealed, circumvented or revised. It is always carried out relentlessly and there is not a single human being who, having fallen asleep after an encounter with poppy, opium or heroin, has not received the most complete instruction in the universe regarding every second of its remaining life. Such human beings become not only excellent workers in one of the areas of the opium industry, but also turn into programmable carriers of all the qualities necessary for work. These human beings can at any time receive additions to their instructions and begin to act differently, but this happens extremely rarely. They, like doves, become the most perfect apparatus for performing certain functions.

***the Packet***

The unconscious behavior of human beings sometimes gives rise to phenomena that are very entertaining for an outside observer. One of these manifestations of unconscious life is quite often expressed as the process of putting dissimilar objects into plastic bags. In this regard, they are the plastic bags that are of interest, and not any other bags. Plastic itself plays an extremely important role in the lives of human beings and greatly simplifies their daily activities. From this synthetic material, one can easily make anything. At first, human beings made various parts and structures from it, and after the moment when they learned how to display a thin and elastic type of plastic, several types of bags began to be made. Only two types of plastic bags matter in the context of this story. These are transparent plastic bags and opaque plastic bags. 

The first type of bags is a kind of universal shell that allows you to keep substances from spilling, getting dirty, wet or influenced by the air. But such a package does not protect against exposure to sunlight, as it passes through. The second type of packages does not let the sun rays through and can save the objects placed in it from a certain effect of solar matter on them. Moreover, opaque plastic bags have the ability to generate uncertainty. This happens when one unconscious being or a group of them places an object in a bag. At first glance, such an action does not cause any hidden or suspicious thoughts and emotions. But this is the view of a pigeon-wing layman who has never seriously approached the question of studying the characteristics of the life of human beings. For those who devote the necessary amount of time to this process, practically any of the actions of human beings is of particular interest in this vein.

When something is placed inside a plastic bag, there is an involuntary formation of uncertainty within the overall Time Crystal. It goes without saying that uncertainty is only present for unconscious human beings, because for those of them who have the knowledge and full understanding that time is a single and common Crystal, uncertainty and unconsciousness are simply absent. The latter human beings can be safely called Humans, and they know absolutely everything and at any moment of time. For the former, uncertainty is the basic law that governs their life. When one of the unconscious human beings sees another carrying something in a package, an interest is spontaneously and immediately generated within the human-being and regarding the contents of this package. This involuntary and unconscious interest becomes the impetus for further actions of the human being observing the packet. Due to the fact that human beings who do not have a sufficient measure of consciousness also do not have a holistic and indivisible "I" and are subject to identification, they involuntarily react to the package they see and begin to be interested in and sometimes even find out with a high degree of certainty what is in the package. Such actions often lead to death. The beginning for death in this vein is the uncertainty that is generated by the simplest, at first glance, object called a plastic bag. In this vein, the package becomes what causes death to a human being. 

Unconsciously putting something from one's own or someone else's, but essentially common things into a bag, a human being sets the course of events that will eventually lead it into one of these plastic bags. It can be said that the more often a human being puts something in a plastic bag, the more likely it is that it will one day be placed in one of the larger plastic bags. The brain of a human being, which does not have a holistic and indivisible "I", performing the usual functions of an intellectual center, begins to identify with this process at its level and eventually ceases to make distinctions about what or who is put inside the plastic bag.

After a certain period of time spent placing various objects inside plastic bags, a human being loses the opportunity to perform this act without increasing the likelihood of himself getting inside the bag. When one of the centers of human activity is identified with the functions it performs, the entire general presence of the human being becomes part of the functions it performs. In other words, a human being who has spent a long time putting things inside plastic bags becomes a part of the process he is carrying out. And knowing the fact that Time is a common and indivisible Crystal, then in essence it can be said that when, due to unconscious activity, a human being is identified with the process it is performing and stops tracking Time, it begins to carry out the mentioned manipulations with its common presence. The division that exists due to the absence of a holistic and indivisible "I" within the common presences of human beings does not allow these beings to realize the fact that the package is nothing but one of the manifestations of the common Time Crystal, which in fact they are too. Without attaching serious importance to this feature of existence, human beings, who are not serious about life, carry, store and transfer various objects inside plastic bags with a high degree of confidence. Over time, the atmosphere of these creatures is filled with the influences of the processes they produce and is saturated with information about these processes, which, of course, affects the behavior of the human beings around them. At the moment when the atmospheres of two or more unconscious living beings are mixed, the influences caused by the processes they produce are transmitted from one to the other, filling the cavities within their atmosphere, if there are any. Those beings who receive rather than give influences fill their atmosphere with new influences and unconsciously begin to transmit them to others. Along with influences, information is also transmitted, which contains the probability of a particular development of events.

Due to the fact that human beings using plastic bags are identified with these bags after a certain time, the influences transmitted by them contain information about the presence of human beings inside the plastic bags. Such influences carry the possibility of a literal realization of the products of the identification of the common presence of human beings, which, under a certain set of circumstances, unambiguously become material. In other words, if a human being receiving influences regarding the placement of one similar to himself inside the package contains enough influences in its atmosphere that represent the manifestation of interest in other living beings and the clarification with a high degree of certainty of what it does not know, then when combined, these influences can cause the receiver to cause death to the one from whom it received these influences. And on a more global scale, human beings are already facing the manifestation of this pattern, as with the accumulation of huge amounts of plastic waste in the oceans. Their unconscious lives lead to the fact that soon they will all be inside one giant plastic bag. And this is extremely unprofitable for the Poppy Dominion, therefore, perhaps in the near future, the process of getting rid of any packages will begin among human beings.

***the Radiation***

Due to the fact that the common Crystal of Time never stays in a static State, but constantly and invariably moves, many processes take place inside it. Naturally they are wave oscillations. Such a definition for these processes was invented by human beings, as is usually the case, they were not conscious enough to accurately convey the nature of the common Time Crystal. Instead of fully feeling and conveying all the information about the common Crystal of Time, human beings began to divide it into separate sections and come up with names and definitions for them, which created a huge number of misconceptions and contradictions in their lives. 

Waves, which in essence are constantly moving sections of the common Crystal, had acquired energetic nature in their presences. Human beings have defined this movement as the transfer of energy from one area through the substance that fills the space to another area. Such an understanding of the nature of the described phenomena is incorrect, because energy is not transferred from one section of the common Crystal to another, because it does not have such an opportunity. 

Energy resides in all areas at the same time, but something else is transmitted. This something is information that determines how and at what moment this or that section of the Crystal should manifest itself.

The separation of the common and single Crystal of Time, which is the already mentioned above delusion of human beings, makes them perceive the Crystal as a multitude of separate and different in nature objects and processes. This view of the world implies that a wave or vibrations that originated in one area must propagate through space to another area and transfer their characteristics to the latter. In fact, only data is transmitted that a certain area should begin to manifest itself differently, due to the fact that some matrix changes have occurred. 

For a better understanding and the representation of the idea of what is being discussed, it is necessary to use in the key of this narrative a description of the process called radiation. This radiation is produced by some dense areas of the common Crystal of Time, according to human beings, spreading it through almost any substance and thereby often changing what they pass through. An excess of this radiation is a by-product of the splitting of atoms, or the increased ability of substances to donate parts of their molecules to others. In general terms, and without going into details, we can say that radiation is present everywhere, but when it is in excess, the atomic structure of some bodies begins to break down or change. This is due to the fact that the atoms that have been exposed to radiation change their composition and the substance itself begins to transfer other properties. But if there really were atoms and their parts, then perhaps human beings would have more control over the range of accidents that are present in their lives. 

If matter was actually a subject to separation, then it would hardly be possible to transmit information without any material carrier, but such an opportunity exists and is actively used by beings with a sufficient level of consciousness. As mentioned earlier, what human beings call information is also a matter. But this matter has a nature so different from what human beings usually attribute to this manifestation of the common Time Crystal that one could call this true nature revolutionary.

The fact is that the very fact of the existence of a crystal lattice and a certain structure that holds protons, neutrons and electrons together makes the force of attraction or what human beings call energy material. It cannot be said that additional matter is used for the existence of attraction in atoms, but it is so. In order to distinguish between what is called matter and energy, it is necessary to say that these two concepts are connected by a substance called force. Human beings tend to believe that force is a consequence of the movement of the energy charge of substances and their components, but this is not entirely true. Force is in fact directly related to energy, but it is more information, that is, what generates energy at the level of intellectual comprehension. The charge or potential that causes atoms and their constituents to rotate and simply exist does not appear out of nowhere either. 

If you do not divide the description of reality into different sciences, such as physics, biology, philosophy, astronomy, mathematics and others, but try to combine all the knowledge and methods of describing reality into one comprehensive system, then the description will be more consistent with the nature of the common Time Crystal. So, we can say that information, which is also matter, is born even before an atom of any substance appears in a certain place. Information should not be tied to particles, since all elementary and microscopic particles of reality that can be noticed in some way, first of all, are knowledge - a thinner substance that contains atoms characteristics. It is often referred to as information. There are also categories of laws that the particles will obey. As a whole the substance is nothing but Time, which is present in everything and everywhere and binds everything by itself. Time determines when and where an atom will appear, how many protons, neutrons and electrons will be in it, as well as how this atom will behave, and in what crystal lattice it will consist, if there will be any.

Everything is united by Time, because the beginnings or root causes of all things are born long before certain events occur. Conditions form and subsequently allow certain events to occur. Taking into account that the Time is a Crystal, there is no need for it to overcome space and spend itself on this overcoming, but it is enough to concentrate in one of the sections of itself. What human beings understand as Time is not such, which again has already been noted earlier, but even a million sheets will not be enough to describe and refute all their delusions, because there are so many of them. The connection that exists between all sections of the common Crystal of Time allows one to transfer information instantly from one section to another and also instantly change the nature of the manifestation of this section.

If human beings believe that wave processes involve the transfer of energy potential from one atom to another, and radiation causes microscopic particles of atoms to penetrate through space into other areas, changing their nature, then this is not so. Good morning. In fact, Time in a view of its most perfect consciousness, changes the nature of the manifestations of individual sections of itself with the highest accuracy. It does this by strengthening the influence of certain laws present inside the common and unified Crystal. These laws cause matter to change and to acquire new properties. Only due to the insufficient degree of consciousness, human beings observe changes in the common Crystal not instantly, but with a certain delay in time. If they could see the root causes or the beginnings of all ongoing processes, they would be able to realize that there was no extension in Time, but there was only one common and indivisible Crystal, which instantly and constantly changed, nevertheless, retaining its primary form. 

If Time was actually divided into segments and intervals, then one could say that every millisecond of the total Time Crystal was another - new and completely transformed. But all the changes in the single and common Crystal of Time were partially perceptible only for living beings, when for the Crystal itself these changes did not exist, but only a flow was present, which was something reminiscent of the breath of living beings. This breath strengthened or weakened the presence of certain laws in certain areas of the common Crystal. It was a consequence of a change in information about the nature of things, which was not a product of the intellectual activity of intelligent beings aimed at comprehending reality, but a thing able to exist because of the very early laws embedded in matter and determining its manifestations.

It is known that poppy fields are the most powerful catalysts for the radioactivity of human beings. This is so because the final or intermediate product of the opium industry, obtained through the work of the poppy fields, influences conditions which living beings exist in. These beings use it to the highest degree. Skeptical human beings may point out that the radioactivity of human beings does not change even due to a change in their energetic state related to their vibrations, but they would not be correct even if all human beings present on the planet Earth were one hundred percent solid in their opinion.

The fact that the final or intermediate product of the opium industry, falling into the general presence of human beings, excited such a reaction of the body to its presence, which not only changed the behavior of the atoms that make up the body of a human being, but also distorted Time, which was a much more serious consequence. the radioactivity of this substance. The energy accumulated by beings who used opium acquired the properties of a flower, which in fact was not such, but was a large cluster of thinking and intelligent beings. These beings had both individual and collective consciousness. The nature of their collective consciousness was built entirely on radioactivity. Radiating waves of different frequencies and ranges, these creatures accumulated them in the upper layers of the atmosphere and combined their presence with the resulting energy-information cloud. This cloud could also penetrate substances of any density, as particles of radioactive substances did and do. This feature allows all members of the poppy family, not all of which belong to the Poppy Dominion, to have permanent access to the database created by the Poppy Dominion. Of course, the level of access to this database varies among different representatives of the poppy family. In addition to access to the common database, all members of the poppy family have the ability to observe all changes in the database over time since the very beginning of the existence of this database.

Some of the most conscious members of the poppy family, related to the Poppy Dominion, have the ability to observe what the state of the database will be in the future. This database contains information about everything that is in the solar system and much beyond it. It does not contain everything at all, just because individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion, who have the highest level of consciousness, have direct contact with the Time and there is no need for them to place information that is accessible only to them for comprehension in a common database. In addition to information, the described formation also contains energy, but not everyone has access to it. It is only accessible to those who are employed in one of the areas of the opium industry. 

This energy is used to create portals, form black holes, kill and of course, with the permission of the Time, change or abolish some of its laws. Considering the fact that information and energy may be required by representatives of the Poppy Dominion  in almost any part of the common Crystal of Time, the energy-information formation is treated as radioactive. This radiation envelops all poppy fields to a greater extent and spreads from them throughout the planet. Each individual red poppy also has radiation, which is fully manifested in its nature. First, it gives away individual particles of itself, which certainly change everything they touch. Secondly, the particles of this supra planetary formation freely penetrate through all obstacles. Thirdly, red poppies have a tremendous influence on everyone who comes close to them. These provisions are also confirmed by the fact that the human beings who were in the same room with the Spider were exposed to radioactive radiation from his side. After consuming opium in another dimension, which subjects those who use this transcendental opium to an even greater change than physical opium use, the Spider and one conscious human being began to radiate into space, which was the beginning of serious changes already partially described in the vein of this narrative and what took place in the room further.

***the Printer***

Despite the all-penetrating property of radiation to penetrate everything in the universe, there are some substances that do not transmit this radiation. These substances absorb particles emitted from radioactive atoms and, thereby, delay the passage of radioactive waves through space. Such substances create resistance at the subatomic level. Of course, this is not the resistance that human beings have defined as the ability of some bodies not to be distorted. Subatomic resistance is some feature of the Time that was researched long ago by the Spider Clan and the Poppy Dominion  in order to use it to control human beings in the future.

When the Poppy Dominion  and the Spider Clan were still using a sharpened and poisoned knife as the main tool for spreading their influence in space, some human beings tried to resist. Such a feature of their behavior caused confusion and an extreme degree of interest among individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan. It has always been known that if someone is destined to die from a spider bite or from an opium injection, then it is useless to resist it, and it is also useless to run away from the assassin's poisoned knife. Accordingly, when in these situations some human beings began to resist for no apparent reason, individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan found such behavior highly inconsistent with what the law usually implied to do. 

After a short study of the behavior of the victims of the mentioned methods of causing death, it was found that any death due to the Time occurs as a result of the penetration of the power of Time into a certain area of the Common Crystal. The Force comes along with the information, or rather, it is a consequence of the compaction of certain information and the strengthening of the influence of certain laws in that section of the Crystal where the information enters. Further research showed that any force is of a triple nature. These are the active, passive and neutralizing or sometimes resultant parts of the force. In the case of death in one of the ways described above, the cause of death was the active principle, the occurrence of death - the passive, and the resistance that sometimes appears was the neutralizing part of the force. Each of the three principles of force carries within it three further subdivisions, which are again active, passive, and neutralizing or resultant elements. Resistance, being the neutralizing element in a given triad of forces, can determine which force will prevail. It depends on which of the forces of the second triad is greater within the resistance.

Studies of the onset of death due to Time have shown that everything within the common Crystal of Time has a triple nature. This feature of Time is one of its fundamental laws, which also determines the existence of the past, the future and the present moment. This feature of the Crystal surprised many of the Spider Clan members and Poppy Dominion representatives, as it served as the initial impetus for the transition from the most brutal murders to less bloodthirsty ways to spread their influence. It was found that if everything has a tripartite nature, then, accordingly, the murder must also have a tripartiteness, which also triples at deeper levels. The Poppy Dominion and the the Spider Clan have determined that the complete suppression of human individuality, often coming close to the physical destruction of a material element, the general presence of a human being, can be carried out not only with the sharpest and most poisonous knife, but also caused by almost any section of the common Time Crystal. In other words, it was discovered that almost any part of the common Time Crystal carries all the characteristics that a very sharp and poisonous knife has. A more thorough study of this feature of Time showed that all those effects that are achieved by injecting a knife into the general presence of a person can be achieved by introducing an image of this knife. The fact is that when making a special image of a poisoned knife and adding vibrational characteristics of the final or intermediate product of the opium industry, a human being begins to perceive the image as a real sharpened and poisoned knife. After the discovery of this possibility, it became necessary to produce images of the knife in large quantities for their further distribution. For this enterprise, a machine was manufactured, called the “printer”, which also consisted of three parts.

One part of the printer was a smooth base made of the perfect ashlar. Another part was a stone plate with an image of a sharp and poisoned knife carved into it, and the third was ink. A cloth or paper was placed on the base, the plate was pressed against it and left an impression exactly corresponding to the image of the knife. This method allowed not only to convey the shape of the knife, but also its influence. The best effect was achieved when the image of a knife on the plate was cut with the same knife that was subsequently depicted on it, and, of course, it was better if the knife was previously poisoned with spider venom. Thus, the knife left its portrait and particles of poison on the plate. Both of these were then duplicated into a certain set of pieces of matter. In some cases, only one image was made, which contained the maximum concentration of knife influences and the largest amount of poison. It was enough to demonstrate such an image to the victim for a fraction of a second, and even in the zone of the second or third attention, as the victim immediately died. Over time, the technique of transferring the influence of the knife was applied to the transfer of the influences of opium, which made it possible to widely disseminate images that completely suppress the individuality of a human being without his physical elimination. Such images later became gestalts widely distributed by the producer of opium of various varieties and types. Another interesting fact that is relevant in the context of this narrative is the delivery of images in special packages with the name of the so-called recipient of this image. In the event that the image of a knife or opium was intended for one human being, then it was placed in a special package on which the name of the recipient was written. Such a package served as a kind of reflection of the general presence of a human being. By the time the image was delivered to the recipient, it had already taken on influences corresponding to those of a knife or opium falling into the general presence of a human being. And from such an image there was and could not be a chance to somehow escape.

Once one of the representatives of the Poppy Dominion  accidentally or deliberately made a plate with an impression of opium. It is believed that this impression was taken from the most real opium poppy that did not grow seeds, which was subsequently canonized. This print produced images that had a range of effects produced. We can say that it could accurately convey all the effects obtained from real opium. So, when later some representatives of the Poppy Dominion  began to distribute images of opium obtained from a real flower, the corresponding effects appeared inside the presences of human beings who had the opportunity to observe these images. Some specific combinations of images of a knife and opium, which were naturally derived from the original ones, engendered special moods in human beings. In one country, images of a knife and opium hung opposite each other caused hundreds of human beings to fight each other. Some of them, when they went to work in the morning, always saw the image of a knife, while others saw opium, and so opposite influences arose in them, which served as an impetus for the revolution. The study of the tripartite nature of power has allowed the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan to develop powers within the presences of human beings that are approximately equal to causing death and resisting death. In the future, the shadow policy pursued by these organizations even made it possible to organize wars between individual supporters of the Spider Clan and the Poppy Dominion, who did not understand that from the immemorial time these two organizations had been acting as one. Of course, after the victory of one of the misguided parties in the revolution, the influence of both organizations increased. But these sections of the common Crystal symbolically began to acquire black or red colors, thereby showing who at the moment controlled the space to a greater extent. Also, the coloring of space in the dominant black or red color made it possible to understand which way of controlling human beings prevails in this area.

***the Angels***

The revolutionary activities of the two organizations began long before the concept of "revolution" was officially put into use. Adepts of the Spider Clan, who received direct instructions from the leadership of the Clan and from the Poppy Dominion, arrived in the most remote corners of the planet and in all major cities in order to continue weaving the web there. It was enough for the presence of one adept in any city of any size to ensure that in the shortest possible time this city was shrouded in a web of secret activity. And after some time, this activity became apparent, and the city came under the control of Poppy Dominion  and the Spider Clan. 

Networks consisting of secret agents, recruiters, detectives, operatives, assassins, professional demolitionists, saboteurs, scouts, experts in poisons, doctors, gunsmiths, armor makers, spies, diplomats, merchants, revolutionaries and in general human and non-human beings of all possible occupations and professions, worked with such coherence and accuracy that the city lost all chances to maintain its sovereignty after at least one of the Clan's adherents appeared in it.

The inevitable transition of the city under the control of the Poppy Dominion and the Clan of the Spider has always been due to the fact that when getting to a new place, the adherents of the Clan always established a spatial connection with the energy-information formation of the Poppy Dominion. After information about where the adept is located and what surrounds him appeared in the universal database, a communication channel with the Clan of the Spider began to form, which increased the universal web of the Clan by one more node. Such a channel transmitted not only information, but also energy. It also had a two-way focus. An adept in a new city could not only send all the information he received to his Clan, but also receive everything he needed through a well-developed channel. 

Opium was also supplied through such channels, which was used to recruit new adherents and suppress their individualities. As a rule, in any new city there were already trained human beings who had heard about opiates somewhere. Even this slightest contact with this supra planetary formation was enough to convey in dreams to these human beings full-fledged instructions for the rest of their lives. Accordingly, the Clan adherents, who have the ability to read information from the atmosphere surrounding human beings, after entering a new city or settlement, immediately found human beings carrying the influence of a red poppy. Having found such candidates ready for work, the adepts transmitted to them certain vibrations that activated the influences already present in them, and the next day these beings themselves, without any prior agreement, began to start working in one or another area of the opium industry. It often happened that the newly minted adepts did not even suspect that they were influenced by individual representatives of the Spider Clan, but thought that they themselves had come to certain conclusions that changed their whole life.

The adepts of the Clan of the Spider have always acted and presently act in accordance with the most precise and complete instructions in the world, which the Poppy Dominion loads into their presence during sleep. Such human beings, after a certain amount of time spent at work, become the most precise and most perfect machines, spreading the influence of Poppy Dominion. These machines do not have individuality, they do not have a holistic and indivisible "I", they do not carry any memory, do not experience emotions, but only every second of their lives execute the instructions with the highest level of accuracy. Quite often, the prescriptions of the instructions require incredible endurance and superhuman efforts from the Clan adherents, and the latter meekly fulfill everything that is in the instructions. Of course, the instruction doesn’t make the new followers of Poppy Dominion start some super-serious and most difficult tasks immediately. 

At first, the adept is prepared by passing him through a series of exercises that change and transform his general presence. Then they turn off the perception of sensations and feelings. Then all thoughts are removed and blocked, except for those that are needed for work. The last step is to limit the emotional range of the adept so that it does not get out of control. At the end of such preparation, the instruction completely replaces all mental manifestations of a human being - it is carried out instinctively, just like an airplane flying on autopilot. 

Before the Poppy Dominion began to use gestalts and oscillators to convey the vibrational characteristics of the final or intermediate products of opium production, new adepts appeared at intervals. If there was a poppy field near a city or a sparsely populated area, then potential adepts appeared every minute and the next day, after receiving instructions at night, they went to work. If there was no field nearby, then all the work of recruiting new adepts fell on the followers of the Spider Clan who worked in that region. Well, when gestalts and oscillators appeared, almost immediately the entire population of the Earth turned into potential followers of the Spider Clan. At that time, when there were still human beings on Earth, possessing the inclinations of individuality and the desire to acquire a holistic and indivisible "I", they were helped by special, developed and conscious living beings. They taught them and helped them achieve self-realization.

Angels, as they called the creatures that contributed to the development of the human race. These consciousness bearers possessed all the qualities of perfect knowledge and deep awareness of the nature of the common Time Crystal. They had the ability to control many laws of Time and accurately conveyed the fullness of its manifestations. Rumor has it that some angels could even save human beings from losing their individuality after facing the Poppy Dominion. They did this by changing the past of human beings, removing the events there that led to the separation of human beings from their individuality. This ability of the angels made human beings believe that they could ask the angels and they would save them from losing their individuality. But the peculiarity of the angels is such that they fully convey the orders of the Time, which created everything and is essentially everything. You can’t ask them for something and wait after this for the fulfillment of your request. 

Nevertheless, human beings continued their petitions, giving them the name of prayer. These prayers became an integral attribute of the "Opium of the People", which forced human beings to believe in the existence of a leadership favorable to them. One of the tenets of most varieties of this psychic opium was the belief in the existence of guardian angels. These superconscious beings allegedly pursued and guarded all living beings without exception, they also recorded everything that happened to the latter. Of course, this approach was organized by Poppy Dominion so that human beings in their prayers would voice everything that they needed. After they had acquired it through exorbitant effort or due to Time, the merit was attributed to the angels. This was beneficial to the Poppy Dominion, since in this way it managed to hide its existence and save its representatives from millions of useless appeals from human beings. Of course, the angels had nothing to do with what human beings acquired in their material life. The Poppy Dominion had nothing to do with this, since all the attributes of the life of human beings, except for what is connected with the production of opium, are at the full disposal of Time. Accordingly, all changes in the lives of human beings have been and remain due to Time, including the acquisition and deprivation of material goods.

The only thing that the angels did was to strengthen the action of certain laws of Time within the general presence of human beings. Knowing that Time is a Crystal, each particle of which reflects the general structure, the angels could activate and deactivate certain parts of it, thereby concentrating the attention of human beings on them. This method of work allowed human beings to notice certain changes in the common Crystal of Time at the right time and, if necessary, and taking them into account, to acquire a holistic and indivisible "I". 

Also, the angels did not have limitations in Time and could work both in the past and in the future. They could both change the states of individual sections of the common Crystal of Time, including the states of the presences of human beings, and form states in the future. Angels were pure manifestations of the common and single Crystal of Time, fully reflecting its structure and conveying all its properties. It was not difficult for them to materialize into a rough form, or to a disembodied state of energy or information. The thing is that the angels, like the common Crystal at different levels of the organization of matter, had separate bodies connected by a single structure. This structure, like everything else in the universe, had an equilateral hexagon at its base.

After the Poppy Dominion  began to use spatial and space-time oscillators, and then gestalts, Time stopped giving orders to angels, since all human beings became under the control of the Poppy Dominion in a very short time. Sometimes you can meet one or another angel, but it happens so rarely that almost none of the human beings from planet Earth believe in them, considering them one of the manifestations of the forces of nature. Some human beings think they believe in angels, but in fact they believe in "Opium of the People", which has nothing to do with real angels, but is a tool to control their common presences and manifestations. Moreover, their beliefs and thoughts are fully and in great detail spelled out in instructions that are instinctively manifested by their common presences.

***the Door***

How the Spider treated angels and other sentient beings, including those present in his quarters, remains unclear. Being a rational and strategically thinking being, the Spider did not betray his emotions, moods and thoughts, he also did not show a feeling of pain or discomfort and knew how to control his instincts. His general presence was thoroughly studied by him and completely subordinated to his own conscious will. In addition to the fact that nothing specific could be said about the Spider, one could easily be mistaken about his intentions and further actions. The Spider superbly manipulated both the train of thought and impressions of one human being, and the opinions of masses of such beings. In his family, the ability to control public opinion and hypnotize human beings was considered as necessary as the ability to quickly and ruthlessly kill other creatures. 

Due to the fact that the Spider maintained a fairly close relationship with his family and never severed family ties, he possessed the most perfect skills in all the areas mentioned. It cannot be ruled out that the Spider personally encountered angels and perhaps knew more about them than anyone else, but due to the extreme secrecy inherent in all the spiders of his family, this point could not be clarified. However, the fact that the amount of knowledge that the most conscious human being had in the same room with the Spider increased throughout the time spent near the Spider may indicate the presence of angelic qualities in the general presence of the Spider.

Compassion, mutual assistance, responsibility, the desire to help other living beings gain consciousness, and the desire to improve the environment are all qualities inherent in angels. Rather, angels do not have their own will and desires, but still have these motives embedded. Moreover, the Spider did not prevent the spread of influences that push human beings to development and evolution. Most likely, he knew that only those who have a sufficient degree of consciousness can perceive influences from the atmosphere and think about their informational component, but there is no need to worry about everyone else. 

However, it is not uncommon for human beings to act mechanically after receiving outside influences, often leading to unpredictable events. Of course, events will be unpredictable only for them, and not for those who have consciousness. Accordingly, it is logical to assume that the Spider did not lose control over the situation for a second and was aware of all his actions and their consequences. The fact that at least one human being, present in the same room with the Spider, was able to endure a fairly serious amount of knowledge and evolve, suggests that the Spider actually could and contributed to this transformation. Accordingly, he possessed the qualities inherent in angels. But what about the fact that the Spider belonged to a Clan that, from time immemorial, existed by killing other living beings and participating in the operations of the Poppy Dominion aimed at the total suppression of the individuality of human beings? Moreover, the Spider may even have held a leadership position in the Clan and had great influence, both within the Clan and throughout the rest of the world. To clarify this question about the combination of seemingly absolutely incompatible qualities within one presence of a living being, it is necessary to turn to the unique possibility of doors and window frames, as well as arches and openings, to become dynamic paintings.

How a living being perceives the world around it depends on the structure of its senses, as well as on how its personality and essence developed during a life. But differences in the perception of the surrounding world by living beings do not make the world different. In other words, if two human beings look at the same city from two different mountains and see it differently, the city does not change. If one creature sees all the houses, and another sees only a part, this does not mean that some houses do not exist. In the same way, if looking through the same frame, perhaps even at the same picture, living beings perceive it differently, the picture does not acquire a dual nature. The only possibility of the existence of a dual nature for the same object or phenomenon arises when one of the two observers is in direct contact with the object or takes part in any observed process, and the second is not.

In the room under the full control of the Spider, there was an opening in the fence for the toilet. The spider was on one side of the opening, and everything that happened was on the other side. So the Spider could observe a certain section of the room, which was also available for viewing to human beings, but the latter were visible through the opening, which made them part of the observed picture. For human beings, there was no opportunity to see themselves through the described opening. Even if one of the human beings looked at the room from the same position as the Spider, it would not be able to see the same thing, since in the time continuum it was part of what would subsequently observe, and the Spider would not. Thus, looking at the same area of the room, the Spider and human beings not only perceived it differently, but actually encountered different manifestations of the common Time Crystal. Being integral parts of what the Spider saw in his opening, human beings acquired the corresponding influences that the Spider transmitted to them, seeing them in the frame. Even if human beings could look at themselves from the same perspective from which the Spider saw them, or could see themselves in a mirror, they could not acquire the same influences that the Spider conveyed to them. These influences just did and forced their nature to acquire some duality.

The fact is that the influences that the Spider transmitted to them and the influences that they would have acquired, looking at themselves from a different position, differed in their class. The influences of the Spider were really vibrations coming from outside, and the influences acquired by human beings as a result of observing themselves from the outside were and remain influences that originated within their common presences. Thus, those influences that come from outside change the general presence of human beings and force them to look at themselves with already assimilated or still assimilating external influences. The influences acquired by human beings as a result of self-observation from the outside will necessarily be built on already assimilated or still assimilating external influences generated by self-observation. This, of course, will affect the nature of the objects of observation and make the observer's conclusions biased, since when the observation ends, the observer's influences will also disappear. In the case when two living beings would simply look at the same picture from different angles, there would simply be no internal influences, but there would be somewhat different external influences that would unite and turn into one common external vibrational influence.

Taking into account the peculiarity of the acquisition of influences of different classes by living beings described above, we can proceed to a description of how incompatible qualities could unite within the common presence of the Spider. Absolutely opposite characteristics that have to exist together within one common presence of a living being can affect its state in different ways. They can either mutually destroy each other, or one of them can destroy the other, or they will destroy the material carrier in which they appeared. So, if emotions that are opposite in nature and direction rage inside a human being, then it can either completely abandon them, or lean to one of the sides, or it will not withstand the pressure and die or lose a significant charge of vital energy. Accordingly, if within the general presence of the Spider there were emotions about how to behave towards human beings, namely, if he were worried about whether to kill them, terrorize them, or, conversely, contribute to their development and in every possible way to help them, he would certainly experience some of the consequences of such an internal conflict, which would definitely affect the state of his general presence. But in view of the fact that the Spider was in imperturbable calm and his energy did not experience serious changes in frequency, it can be noted that there was simply no internal conflict within his general presence. 

Accordingly, the Spider, most likely, once long ago abandoned the experience of conflicting emotions and enjoyed inner peace. He managed to achieve this by having the ability to open doors. And not some abstract doors that do not exist in the material world, but the most real wooden or metal doors. In order to get rid of the internal conflict, the Spider opened one of the nearest doors and passed through it, moving away from what could cause such a conflict. Of course, he closed the opened door behind him, which additionally protected him from the source of potential internal conflict. The only difference in how Spider and human beings did it was that Spider opened and closed doors with his second body. His physical body never left its corner, at least no one saw it.
Being a conscious creature, the Spider has long taken care of accumulating enough energy to create a second body, which not only could easily move in space, overcoming all sorts of obstacles, but also affect the rough material world. So in those moments when the Spider needed to decide how he should treat some living beings, he took his second body out the door, and allowed the first to do what was most appropriate for the situation. If he needed to kill someone, then at that moment one of his bodies was killing, and the second felt compassion for those who were dying outside the door, which did not allow two emotions that were opposite in character and direction to exist in one body. Moreover, having a holistic and indivisible "I", the Spider could simultaneously generate, acquire and track the influences of different classes. By observing himself from the position of his second body, he could send external influences to his physical body and at the same time generate internal influences. In order to prevent internal influences from being formed on the basis of acquired external influences, the Spider distributed them in Time. This way of evaluating one's actions is necessary to analyze the consequences and their possible prevention. If human beings look at themselves from the side purely inside their intellectual center, modeling their presence and imagining all kinds of processes involving the model, then the Spider was present in two places at the same time. Accordingly, he had the ability to move along the time corridor, where one of his bodies was in the present moment, and the other freely moved in Time.

***the Corridor***

The ability to distribute influences over time is available to those living beings who can keep track of different classes of influences and also take into account the changes that will occur after the influences have reached their peak and changed the overall presence of the one who perceives them. This ability is used by some living beings in order to track changes in their general state as accurately as possible. In the case when there is no differentiation of the peaks of influences in time, all influences are mixed into one, which makes it difficult to distinguish them. Of course, with a detailed analysis of one's general state, there is an opportunity to divide all influences into classes and evaluate their individual effect, but by the time the results of this analysis are ready, new influences will appear that will force the analysis to be repeated. Without the ability to distribute influences over time and assess their effect in the future and at the time of their peak activity, there is no way to reliably and accurately determine what state the general presence of a human being will assume in the future. In order to make such an analysis, the Time corridor is used.

After the Spider took his second body out of the physical and closed the door behind him, a corridor with many similar doors and rooms opened in front of him. Also in this corridor there were doors to the supply room, the medical office, the duty officer's office, the local area and the exercise yard. The spider was able to use any of the doors present in the corridor. Getting into rooms similar in design and filling, the Spider could observe the development of the same scenario, but in a different reflection. All those doors that led to rooms with a similar purpose opened up for the Spider the opportunity to track how exactly the same situation developed as in his room, but in a parallel world. In these rooms there were other human beings who could have a completely different scenario of their lives, but only until the moment they got into the rooms of the described corridor. 

Once inside one of these rooms, human beings turned from separate representatives of the human race with different histories and lives into participants of one common action that took place in the premises of the already mentioned corridor. All their activity was reduced to tracking the Time, and all the space available to them was created in one image and likeness of the common Crystal of Time, which simplified the whole process. The premises have always been a space bounded by four walls and resembling a cube or parallelepiped in shape. This form is the middle of the common Crystal of Time, which is obtained from the square located between the two vertices of the hexagon underlying the common Crystal.

Possessing the ability to read information from the atmosphere surrounding human beings, the Spider, having penetrated into one of the rooms of the corridor, could learn everything about the life of the living beings who were in the room. He could trace their entire history and calculate their future based on time-separated external and internal influences. Knowing what human beings would do in a short time, the Spider could determine what influences the beings would acquire from the actions they performed. After that, he could calculate when these influences would reach their peak and how this would affect the general condition of human beings. The separation of external and internal influences lies in the fact that, while tracking the development of external influences, the Spider also monitors the development of internal influences that develop without external interference. 

The inner influences change their course of development only after the outer influences reach their peak and change the general presence of the human being. Before the outer influences reach their peak, they are in the atmosphere of the human being and affect only his relations with the outer world, but do not affect the inner world and the influences present in it. Only after the peak of their activity can external influences penetrate into the inner world of a human being and influence him, but this does not always happen. Sometimes external influences can simply die out after the peak of their activity, and remain at the level of the atmosphere of a human being. It is in order to know when external influences penetrate the inner world and begin to change it that the ability to separate influences in time is used.

Walking along the corridor, the Spider could not only observe the course of events in parallel worlds, but also could see how the situation in his own world would develop in the near or distant future. So he could see what would happen to him and the human beings in the same room with him, and, of course, he could rewind Time back in order to remember what happened in the past. In addition to simply observing the course of events, the Spider could influence him using the energy of his second body. For example, the Spider could transmit certain external influences to human beings and even to himself in the past, which changed them and his behavior in the present, and he could also leave reminders or direct instructions to perform an action, experience a particular emotion or think about a certain thoughts in the future. All such activity requires the use of free energy, which allows you to create stable vibrations that will be in the past or future and not be distorted due to changes in the Time Corridor. If the energy is not sufficiently ordered, then any unforeseen change in one of the parallel worlds of the corridor can affect the vibrations so that they become useless, lose their connection with Time or space, are not fully realized, or simply disappear. But in view of the fact that the Spider possessed sufficiently powerful sources of energy and information described earlier, he did not experience such problems, and his energy-information loads always reached their destination in complete safety. 
Also, the Spider had a fairly long practice in the field of space-time manipulation, which made his skills in this area perfect. He could literally and completely change the whole life of a human or any other being from his birth to a moment in one of the variants of the present in one second. Moving his second body into the past, life in the present continued, but taking into account all the changes that his second body made in the past. So, if the Spider had the need, he could organize a human being's encounter with opium in the past, upload the full instructions of the Poppy Dominion into the general presence of this being, then train him for a long time and by the time from which his second body went on this task, the human being will already be an adept, ready to perform super-difficult tasks. For an external layman, the entire described process may not take even a second, when in the time continuum it lasts a certain Time. For the one who underwent such an operation with a change in the past, everything happened literally at one moment and subsequently there were no doubts about his new past. Of course, in order for the adept to have no internal contradictions about how he lived before meeting the Spider, everything had to be changed and sewn with a jeweler's precision or nano engineer, which not everyone possesses. But the Spider in question had such a level of accuracy, and, accordingly, everyone who fell into his field of view or into the alleged field of view in one of the parallel worlds instantly became subject to him, and he could change their general presence up to the fourth level completely and totally in the shortest possible time.

This ability to change the past and, accordingly, the future was achieved by him after a long practice in the field of separation of influences over time. Of course, for a third-party layman, even with a fairly high level of consciousness, there is no way to trace such super-complex and ultra-precise manipulations that have no response in the present. Everything that human beings experience in the present, after changes have occurred in their common presence or in the presences of living beings next to them, is limited to a slight feeling of deja vu. And that such a feeling is caused only by the fact that the intellectual center of a human being, subjected to a change in the past, is set to perceive one of the re-experienced moments with some changes, as exactly the same as it was before the changes were made. There is not the slightest possibility for a human and any other living being to notice that all of their past or a certain part of it has been changed, because the information about how it was before the changes were made takes on completely new qualities and state.

Just like energy, information cannot be completely removed because it is also material, but it is possible to completely change all its characteristics, which will create the effect of removing the past. Also, in order for a creature not to notice changes in its past, it is necessary to change everything that was connected with the changing moments in its life. Otherwise, when objects or subjects appear that took part in the life of a creature subjected to changes in the past, in the general presence of this creature, a feeling of the so-called cognitive dissonance may arise, which will bother him with various sensations caused by the remnants of memory associated with the creatures or objects that have appeared.

***the Cyphers***

Those followers of the Clan, who have not yet reached the perfect level in the field of changing the past of other living beings, use cypher to smooth out the consequences of such changes. For the general presence of human beings who do not have a high degree of consciousness, cyphers appear as generators and blockers of some stimulating impulses and motives. They have a principle of operation similar to one of some gestalts, but due to the fact that they constantly move along with their carriers and are intended to be perceived by strictly defined human beings, they do not change the surrounding space in the same way as gestalts do. 

Cyphers are details of outerwear or service uniforms of human beings with a changed past. They are designed in such a way that at the time of the collision of the beings with their acquaintances from the past, who did not have certain areas of their memory replaced with new ones, the cyphers suppress the impulses associated with remembering this past. Cyphers force human beings to build relationships based on new information and suppress the resulting sense of cognitive dissonance. This method is a kind of insurance, which additionally emphasizes the status of the Clan's adherents and makes them and all those around them perceive new adherents as elements who have been all their lives involved in the affairs of the Clan.

The action of cyphers can be two-way. In addition to making human beings forget the past, they also arouse in them certain motivating impulses that force them to behave differently, as the situation demands of them. The action of cyphers is based on the vibrational nature of reality. In a small object resembling a badge or patch, vibrations are embedded that contain information designed to organize the relationship of human beings in pre-thought out and planned situations. 

These vibrations are stored in a special sequence of colors, symbols and shapes, which enter the field of vision or atmosphere of human beings and affect the work of their intellectual and sometimes emotional centers. Suppresses the desire to behave in a certain way, or encourages to do certain actions. Accordingly, if one of the members of the Spider Clan made changes in the past of human beings and cannot be one hundred percent sure in the change of the entire memory of the human being subjected to the transformation and all of the environment that has ever had contact with the latter, then the member makes sure that on the outer clothing or a form of a human being with a changed past, a corresponding cypher appeared in a certain place, which, in the event of contact with old acquaintances, would change the nature of their relationship.

In addition to organizing interactions with human beings who do not take part in the affairs of the Clan, but are simply its sources of raw materials and consumers of the final or intermediate product of the opium industry, cypher is used to organize relationships within the Clan. These transmitters of information force junior adepts of the Clan to obey their elders unconditionally and quickly, and also indicate what role certain adepts play in the affairs of the Clan. Due to the fact that the Clan has a huge number of positions and areas of activity, the number of cyphers is also large. 

Therefore, the adherents of the Clan do not remember them, but simply wear them. Part of the information about cyphers is loaded in dreams along with the instructions, and partly it is contained in the cyphers themselves. In order to avoid overloading human beings with unnecessary information, the principle of perception of cyphers is only formed in them, and all information about their meaning is transmitted at the time of interaction. 
It is also necessary to emphasize that, as mentioned earlier, there are no wave oscillations, and, accordingly, there is no possibility of energy transfer through space. All that exists in reality is the strengthening or weakening of the influences of certain laws of Time in different parts of the common Crystal. Therefore, cyphers do not transmit, as is commonly believed, information from one carrier to another, but create a certain atmosphere, within which the action of certain laws of Time is strengthened, while others are weakened. Accordingly, when human beings see cyphers, their minds simply undergo a rearrangement of information, which is caused by falling into the atmosphere of cyphering. They forget something, believing that this has never happened, and they consider something that has always existed in their lives, sometimes even from the moment of birth.

***the Glue***

The property of glue to penetrate into the crystal lattice or sublevels of substances, and then dry up, thereby connecting different parts of matter, like nothing else is suitable for describing phenomena associated with changes in the vibrational manifestations of information. Material processes exist at those levels where a human being can no longer notice the material presence, but can only feel the consequence of the presence of certain substances. 

This similarity is due to the influence of the same laws on subtle information processes and on gross material ones. The presence of the same laws makes matter behave in exactly the same way at all levels of its existence. The difference lies only in the number of laws acting on matter. Where the substance is denser, there are more laws, and where it is lighter, accordingly, there are fewer. 

So, if at the physical level the presence of a real glue is necessary in order for two pieces of matter to connect and begin to exist together as one object, then at a level more consisting of energy and information, the glue replaces the presence of vibrations of a certain kind. These vibrations penetrate other structures in the same way and gradually unite them, turning them into one.

Particles of information that are hidden from ordinary human perception, but accessible to a developed Human having a high level of consciousness, as well as a genuine indivisible “I”, exist in the form of clots of the finest energy inside the common Crystal of Time. This energy has a lot of properties and characteristics that can easily change, and can remain unchanged for millions of years. Such matter vibrates on a variety of ranges and with a variety of frequencies, which allows it to transmit manifestations of the common Time Crystal in a variety of forms. 

It can be a thought, an emotion, a feeling, an instinct, a sensation, everything that the human body can experience, and even something that is beyond its normal perception, for example, Time. Because different centers within the common presence of a human being also vibrate at different frequencies and with different characteristics, matter of different quality is attached to them. This happens due to the vibrations that are contained in the atmosphere of a human being and act as an energy glue. 
When another human being or something that may contain vibrations similar in frequency gets into the area filled with glue, the glue penetrates into the atmosphere of an external object and, when drying, takes with it a certain amount of particles of matter. This is very similar to the attraction that exists between magnets. The process of gluing in reality is similarly present inside the common Crystal of Time everywhere, so that the world seems whole and indivisible. This process is not only energetic, but also informational.

If attraction causes matter to be attracted according to certain laws, then glue is less subject to such laws and it can be used to glue seemingly absolutely non-sticky objects and phenomena. For example, it is possible to attach an aura from a flower to a gross material object, such as a stone, or to fill it with sounding music. 

This possibility exists due to the fact that Time is a common and indivisible Crystal. Knowing this, one can force the information, which is knowledge about the nature of a flower, its smell and properties, to penetrate and gain a foothold inside that section of the common Crystal of Time, where the most ordinary stone is located. Without the use of the glue, the information will not linger for a long time in the area where there is no suitable material carrier. But with the participation of a substance resembling ordinary physical glue in its properties, it is possible to achieve the widest successes in the field of transforming one thing and phenomena into another. 

This is exactly how the Spider Clan, gluing the cypher to the outerwear or uniform of a new adept, at the same time glues information that substitutes or adds a certain part of the past of the adept. Once got into the atmosphere of this cypher, other human beings also fall under the influence of the glue, which dries up and fastens the necessary information with their crystal lattice by penetrating into their common presence.

Parallel worlds and events taking place in them are attached to each other in the same way as information attached to certain bodies, forces them to show properties different from the original ones. If one human being was attached by means of an energy-informational substance resembling physical glue to another human being in a parallel world, then their general interactions with the outside world begin to acquire the same qualities and direction as the drying glue. It ultimately leads beings to identical rooms inside the corridor of Time.

Parallel worlds, which are essentially large balls filled with smaller balls that reflect their characteristics, stick together at their points of contact. If one of the points of contact contains information about the contact of one world with another, but not with the one with which it actually touches, then one of the worlds will acquire the properties of another, about which information is contained in the point of contact. 

On the basis of this property of the worlds, discovered by the Poppy Dominion as a result of studying the influence of one opium flower on another, individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion and members of the leadership of the Spider Clan got the opportunity to open space-time portals. Use a space-time two-way multichannel energy-information conductor, transmitting vibrational properties of the final or intermediate products of the opium industry through space-time oscillators. And give some individual sections of the solid and indivisible Time Crystal the properties of black holes, as well as perform some other manipulations related to space-time distortions. 

Despite the fact that all information obtained as a result of research on the gravitational nature of opium is well hidden by the Poppy Dominion, there is still a possibility to find out about it and learn something. Such an opportunity is open for everyone who interacts with Time for a long time and acquires a sufficient amount of information about its nature of a common and indivisible Crystal. 

The acquisition of such an opportunity is accompanied by an increase in the consciousness capacity to be accumulated within a whole and indivisible "I", within the common presence of a human being and a certain desire to be solid. But to date, no one has actually found a holistic and indivisible "I", which could steadily follow the goal and not respond to external influences.

The problem lies in the fact that because of functioning ever-working and never turning off oscillators of the Poppy Dominion, all human beings have acquired a connection with others located in parallel worlds. Poppy Dominion literally glued all of them together, thereby uniting the inhabited worlds into one crystal lattice. The organization greatly simplified its tasks related to the spread of influence. And if some innovations appear related to the impact on the general presence of human beings, then by applying them in one section of the common Time Crystal, information about them is immediately transmitted to all the others. 

At first glance, it may seem that the Poppy Dominion did not need to glue all the presences of human beings and their worlds into one crystal lattice. The latter were already inside the common Time Crystal, which a priori kept them inside one crystal lattice. The additional imposition of the laws of the Poppy Dominion made human beings and their worlds subject to all the influences of the Poppy Dominion. And these additional laws elevated the Poppy Dominion itself and, of course, the Spider Clan above the human race, since the organizations are not subject to these new laws and do not experience consequences of the presence of the laws. 

By creating an additional crystalline grid for human beings and their worlds, the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan lowered them to a lower and coarser level, at which they became easier to control, and from which it became more difficult to escape. At this level, human beings with their worlds are subject to all the same laws as the Poppy Dominion  along with the Spider Clan, plus all the laws of a new crystalline grid created with a substance resembling physical glue.

Of course, the restriction of the freedom of human beings did not end there, and even at this level, subject to many laws, human beings themselves began to limit themselves by the emergence of new laws and new restrictions, which made them even more controllable. Obviously, having lost all free will and the opportunity to gain individuality back in ancient times, human beings became slaves of the Poppy Dominion. And now they act on the basis of the instructions laid down in them in accordance with the laws acting at their level. 

It would be foolish to assume that the Poppy Dominion has written in its instructions containing prescriptions for every second of the remaining life of human beings, specific actions that the latter should perform. All that is embedded in the instructions is information that determines the level of influence of certain laws at a certain time within the general presence of the bearing human being. These laws, in turn, determine what specific actions will be performed by human beings, since they cannot escape from their influence and must obey them totally.

The only opportunity to escape from the action of certain laws created by gluing the presences of human beings into an additional common crystal lattice was told by the Spider to that conscious human being who had been in the same room with him for a certain time. This stay looked like a limited time period only to an external observer, while for the Spider and for the conscious human being Time was not limited. Both of them could travel to another dimension to consume the final or intermediate products of the opium industry, and by closing the door behind them, they could easily move through the Time Corridor, visiting other worlds and observing their past and future development. 

Having shown the human being how to influence the development of actions in other worlds, the Spider conveyed information on how to limit or increase the influence of certain laws in certain areas of the common Time Crystal. This information was the key to unraveling how to achieve liberation from the influences of certain laws. The first step towards liberation was to determine one's final or intermediate goal, which was best written on a piece of paper, which would always be in the field of view of the one who wrote something on it.

***the Pen***

At the moment when the Spider transmitted information about the importance of writing the final or intermediate goal on a constantly monitored piece of paper, the human being experienced the feeling that now it was not the Spider at all, but a wise old man in a turban, green robes of a Sufi sheik and with a gray beard. The eyes of the Sufi were the eyes of a baby. This sensation overcame the perception of objectively perceived reality and completely took over the general presence of a human being. In this illusion, it was inside some kind of oriental cafe, however, located on the streets of a large western metropolis.

This cafe had two floors: on the first one you could taste different types of tea, sweet and spicy, relaxing and tonic, and on the second there was a space for meditation and prayer. Having passed along the stairs, the human being got to the second floor of the perceived establishment and sat down on the mat, cross-legged. After about five minutes, the sheikh appeared and sat on his bent legs, as was always the custom among Muslims - mostly on his left leg. He began his story by talking about some special perception of Sufi meditation, which allows one to gain consciousness and later use one's common presence more effectively. 

He said this: “All the technologies, that we have, prolong the functions of our body. How we perceive them is entirely up to us. We can see them as inanimate machines, or we can use them as a means to achieve our spiritual goals. In meditation, we learn concentration by focusing on our heart. It is the essence and center of our common presence. It connects the physical world of body sensations with the mental world. Through it, we are connected to the common Crystal of Time. All connections that are inside the Crystal pass through our heart with great speed. Through it, angels influence us, and it also plunges us into error. The heart needs conscious development and purification. It accumulates love, and if it is not developed, then love will not linger in it, and without love this heart will die and destroy the entire common presence.

Looking at the development of technology, we will see that much of it depends on the ability to transfer information in space from one point to another. The most striking example of the transmission and storage of information in space is the Internet. This phenomenon is a direct extension of the structure of the Crystal in our world. The Internet reflects the materialization of connections within the Crystal. For us, the connections that hold information in a certain structure at the highest levels of the common Time Crystal are more interesting. But in order to understand how to connect to these levels and how to interact with them, you can turn to the phenomenon of the Internet.

Previously, the Internet was connected to a telephone line and was available through a regular telephone modem, which required the user to purchase a card that made it possible to use the network for a certain time. In meditation, this technology can be compared with the initial level of practice. A human being learns to concentrate. It resembles the process of connecting a telephone modem to the Internet. This is a long process, forcing you to wait every time you connect to the network and then use the connection at a slow speed. 

After the practitioner learns to maintain connection with the higher levels of the common Time Crystal, it is possible to gain a connection similar to a dedicated line, ethernet. At this level, the connection is faster and the speed is much higher. The next stage will allow it to always be connected to the Internet, that is, to be in constant communication with the highest levels of the common Crystal of Time, as well as distribute the Internet to others, like a wi-fi router. These levels differ in the amount of accumulated solar matter or divine love in the region of the heart of a human being.

Sufi meditation is based on the accumulation of solar matter, which allows you to receive and transmit information at speeds exceeding the speed of light. The ability of a human being to perceive such interactions is determined by the level of consciousness and compassion for other living beings, which is expressed as the presence of free energy in the region of the heart. The heart is the concentration of emotions or the emotional center in the common presence and is the fastest receiver and transmitter of certain manifestations of the common Time Crystal. 

Having acquired a sufficient amount of free solar matter in the region of the heart, a human being can direct it like a laser, and inside this laser transmit information in the same way as it happens when writing any information on a CD. Having learned to interact at such high speeds, a human being acquires the ability to make direct contact with angels and saints, which gives the former the same skills and abilities as of the latter. It can also strengthen and weaken the influences of certain laws of Time in certain areas of the common Crystal, including the common presences of other human beings. Its effect can be both healing and destructive.

Having reached this level, the Man is freed from the action of the laws of the gross material world and begins to fully transmit the manifestations of the common Crystal of Time, as angels or saints do. Becomes a perfect site of the common Crystal of Time. In the future, such a Person can leave the physical body and be in several places at the same time, hear what is not heard by others and see what is hidden from the eyes and hearts of others.”

The Sheikh ended his story with a small parable about the pen. He said that the greatest gift that the Merciful and the Compassionate Allah has given to humanity is a writing stick or a pen, a stylus. This object tends to be held between the energy and information flows passing through the fingers of human beings, which reflect the state of their individualities and souls, if any is present. Being held in this place, the pen organizes the connection of a conscious Man with the higher worlds within the common Crystal of Time, and allows one to translate the information coming from the higher worlds into a language understandable for human beings and vice versa. One for writing - and one without ink or a closed one for reading. 

***the Knots***

What human beings call atoms and molecules, in their conception, has vibrations that generate waves in space. These waves, having different characteristics, unite and form matter in all its manifestations. Each separate part of it has a field, which is also essentially a union of waves, but of a different quality. In order to somehow fix the concepts of certain properties of matter, human beings came up with an alphabet. More precisely, they were able to convey the wave characteristics of individual particles in the form of their written expression or symbols. Before this was done, information was transmitted only orally and was highly susceptible to distortion.

Human beings, telling each other about past events or about something that required the transmission of accurate information, often changed the sound, which subsequently changed the meaning of the transmitted. When writing was invented, they were able to store information in the form of books and drawings, which greatly improved the quality of conveying meanings. Some individual waves that were used more often than others in the speech of human beings took on the form of symbols that could be read and voiced. Initially, each individual wave or sound had a certain semantic character, which, when voiced or read, evoked certain sensations inside the presences of human beings associated with their memory. Certain sections of the common Crystal of Time, which once received a name, were stored in the memory of human beings in the form of images, and it were these images that began to be called up by voicing or reading the waves fixed in the symbols.

Some creatures transmitted waves indicating the number of symbols called numbers, and those that were purely figurative in nature were called letters or hieroglyphs. Other human beings did not distinguish between systems of symbols that conveyed quantitative and qualitative character, but wrote everything down together. So in some civilizations the alphabet appeared. It was a kind of system that combined symbols or hieroglyphs, and sometimes both, to form words, which later began to convey more complex meanings than the qualities of objects and phenomena. If the symbols could only convey some of the basic qualities of the overall Time Crystal, then the words resulting from the combination of these symbols began to convey actions and describe everything in more detail. 

Words were combined into sentences, which made it possible to transmit information in the form of bundles of waves, causing associations in the presences of human beings, which were then stored in their memory. If there were none, then certain combinations were created that could approximately convey the meaning of the described object or process. This way of transmitting information made it possible to create texts that later became books, and then they were collected in libraries and, in the end, libraries turned into databases that store the history and culture of human beings. Almost everything that ever happened in their lives was given text or graphic form and was saved. But it was not always so.

Before beings learned to give symbolic expression to waves, information was transmitted orally, but even before that, it was transmitted either telepathically or instinctively. Of course, only those living beings could transmit information telepathically, who had direct contact with Time and understood that it was a Crystal. And in order for its certain characteristics to manifest somewhere, it is not necessary to excite vibrations of space, but it is enough just to focus your attention on the form of manifestation of the Crystal that was required. 

Further, this information received coordinates within the common Crystal of Time, where it needed to manifest itself, and there it began to take on a given form. Those who have never had direct and conscious contact with the Time were forced to somehow influence each other and thereby encourage each other to reproduce certain actions. Such influence was most often instinctive, not carrying any semantic or emotional load. The creatures either nudged each other to something that their common presence needed at that moment, or somehow reacted to external stimuli. In both cases, the action was mechanical.

When it became possible to save information, the creation of large information centers began, which further spread their influence. These centers were created by some living beings, and then they began to form others. They attracted the attention of human beings, and when it fell into their atmosphere and focused on them, they began to introduce information about some objects or phenomena into the common presences of these human beings. 

It became possible to create purely artificial centers that completely directed the attention of human beings to the study of non-existent things. These centers began to be widely used by Poppy Dominion  to spread their influence. Their main task was to spread knowledge about the nature of the common Crystal of Time, which was actually a psychic poison, which received the name "Opium for the people" long before the appearance of such centers. 

Initially, these were just repositories of information, which later acquired their workers, designed to help human beings who came to find information of interest to them more efficiently. Since these workers did not appear in the centers themselves, and these centers could not appear by themselves either, we can conclude that they performed all the actions according to the instructions. And since Poppy Dominion knew in advance who and when would come to such a center, the workers were instructed to give out strictly certain information to the human beings who came, which accelerated their encounter with the physical opiate or placed its energy and informational influences in their common presence.

Once having entered such a center, the human body could come out ready for work as an adept of the Clan of the Spider or a slave of Poppy Dominion. Through the joint efforts of pre-prepared books, which were the first type of instructions introduced into the presence of human beings, and the actions of workers in this area, information on how to spend every second of the rest of life was tied to those who came to the described centers. Thanks to this method, one of the threads of the Clan's common web was attached to a human being by means of an energy-information node, which played the role of a link. In the future, other threads in similar centers could be tied to such a knot. In addition to constantly evoking in the common presences of human beings the desire to return to one of these centers or to do a certain type of work, the knot could attach a human being to a certain area of the common Time Crystal and not let them out of there.

Information about all knots was collected in a single center. From there, Poppy Dominion  could receive information about everything that happened in its centers, about how many workers there were and how many new adepts, as well as what type of activity they were engaged in. As well, Poppy Dominion could receive information about all knots located outside the centers, since they were all connected by threads that transmitted information and sometimes energy in two directions. Thanks to such a system, each adept of the Clan of the Spider had the opportunity, once in a new city or settlement, to immediately transfer information directly to the leadership and receive appropriate instructions. 

The overall system was a superplanetary web that still looked like the root structure of all the flowers in the Poppy Field. The only difference between the design of the poppy roots and the web was that poppies mainly transmitted information through the atmosphere, while spiders through their webs. But with a deeper study of these phenomena, it was found that both reflect the structure of the common Time Crystal quite well, which definitely made the two systems related and similar. Each adept of the Clan of the Spider who worked long enough in the mentioned sphere had the ability to tie new human beings to his knot and through his knot stretched the thread from them to any major center or directly to the leadership. But only real spiders, who had perfect information about the structure of the web, could disconnect someone from the knots.

It should be noted that knots were used to a greater extent before the appearance of spatial oscillators and gestalts, since after their appearance the entire planet fell under the influence of Poppy Dominion and its wave. The work of the oscillators immediately absorbed all the presences of human beings and, having read all their information, began to track their movements and changes in their general presences.

***the Music***

The general picture of the planet Earth after the appearance of spatial oscillators began to represent a web connecting different points into a single network. These points were divided into categories denoting beings, objects, phenomena and processes. Each individual point had its own atmosphere and the presence or absence of connection with other points within its own and other categories. Everything was painted in different colors, which reflected the vibrational characteristics of the points. Such a map has become a direct reflection of everything that is happening, but only in a different dimension. It was that dimension where everything that existed was contiguous balls. The general picture was enclosed in a circle, which represented the Earth.

Watching this map, one could notice the incessant movement, which was accompanied by sound. This sound was transmitted to everyone who had access to this picture. For an uninitiated layman, the sound of the general map of the planet was a set of noises that did not make any sense. But for someone who had information about the structure of the common Time Crystal, this music had a clear structure, which always acted on the same principle. This was and remains the principle of the presence of an octave structure in everything that exists within the common Crystal of Time. 

Each octave contains seven notes, and the eighth is a reflection of the first, but at the next higher frequency level. Having noticed one sound, an understanding listener could determine how it will develop, and what turn the developing events will take. This principle allowed Poppy Dominion to calculate the future and, on the basis of its calculations, upload into the presence of human beings the most complete instructions in the universe, which contained instructions on how to spend every second of the rest of their lives.

Knowing that there is an octave structure everywhere, Poppy Dominion could observe the spread of influences within the balls and not only predict their development, but also change the movement of the octave through the formation of certain impulses, which led to the desired results. Of course, only having an exact knowledge of at what moment and what kind of impetus should be given to the developing octave, it was possible to achieve some predictable result. Without such knowledge, any impact, as well as a simple definition of results, became impossible. 

For the same individual representatives of Poppy Dominion who had direct contact with Time and knew how and in accordance with what laws it manifests itself, the whole picture was music expressed in the form of points establishing and breaking the connection with each other and changing their atmosphere.

This music sounded in the room that the Spider received at his disposal from the Poppy Dominion. And also this music sounded on poppy fields. It sounded while playing backgammon, and it was broadcast on TV. It sounded in space, it could be heard in fire. This music could be found anywhere, but only on one condition, it was important to know that Time is a Crystal, and that everything in the world is connected and never divided into parts. 

Such knowledge was most likely contained in singing crystals, information about which was preserved only in the form of legends. Inside one of these living stones, its endless reflections could be observed, which eventually became points, exactly the same as on the map of Poppy Dominion. These points had their own atmosphere, and by concentrating on one of them it was possible to trace all its changes from birth to death. In those parts of the Crystal where dots supposedly existed, but disappeared, or were supposed to appear in the future, or simply disappeared for some time, it was possible to restore information about them. 

This information was revealed by concentrating on the music of that section and moving up or down the octave of its notes. Shifting down allowed one to go into the past and see how this octave developed to the present state, and moving up allowed one to see what will happen in the future.

In order to be able to distinguish sounds within a common melody, a conscious being had to practice for a long time in the separation of influences in Time. Otherwise, all music appeared to him as a single changing wave. After the singing crystals disappeared for the bulk of human beings, information about them, along with the principle of their work, was preserved only in Time. Access to this information is open only to those who have direct contact with the Time and have a high level of consciousness. With sufficient practice, such beings acquire the ability to connect to the common Crystal of Time and transmit all its characteristics to the full, which also reveals to them most of the information contained within the Crystal.

PART 3 - NEUTRALIZING FORCE

***the Conveyor***

The corner room was littered with furniture in one of the buildings on the planet Earth, into which a conscious being got after parting with the Spider and other beings who were present at one time in some other room in a different building. Old armchairs were piled one on top of the other, tables, a sofa, a safe and a corner chest of drawers stood nearby. Also there was soil, inside which the seeds of decorative flowers were already ripening. This room was a reflection of the state of the general presence of the human being who got there, and indicated that it was in disarray. This disorder was caused by the spatial movements necessary to change the environment and prepare the human being for a special form of production related to those areas in which the Spider was engaged.

With enough training in the room where the Spider lived, the creature could get into any part of the general Time Crystal and engage in any of the existing activities. The information that the Spider conveyed to a human being, conscious enough to perceive and comprehend it, allowed him not only to continue to steadily follow the goal set by his formed integral and indivisible "I", but also to overcome a large number of the most difficult obstacles.

Spider had a wealth of experience in shaping the presences of human beings and changing their past. He could appear before them in any guise, he could easily form any situation and involve them in any process, but with this creature he behaved differently. He appeared before the human being in his natural form and showed him the true nature of the Time Crystal. After meeting with the Spider, the human being gained knowledge about the conveyor of Poppy Dominion, which recently acquired its completed form. Of course, the principle underlying it has been known since the beginning of time, but only relatively recently has the conveyor become perfect. 

The division of labor and duties among the workers in the opium industry allowed the Poppy Dominion to shape the presence of human machines in the same way as it does to shape the finished form of automobiles. Individual representatives of the Spider Clan, who have the ability to give their physical body any shape, are combined into groups, which represent a conveyor. All information is fed into these groups through the network formed by the Clan of the Spider, or directly through their atmosphere, and then they carry out their duties in accordance with the instructions.

Some groups are busy making scaffolds to form the presences of human beings. These frameworks are foundations or basic forms of behavior that are transmitted through the involvement of human beings in certain typical situations. Other groups connect these situations and the human beings involved in them. The following add to them features intended for different human beings, thereby breaking them down into categories. There are also groups that test human beings that have received some foundation, and still others that work on bringing human beings to their final form. There are other groups that are individual in nature, but they do not always participate in the process, but only in special situations, or with special types of human beings who will perform specific tasks. 

The room in which the Spider was located was part of one of the sections of the general conveyor of Poppy Dominion. There, human beings acquired certain qualities after they received some basic training. The spider was engaged in the fact that he prepared human beings to connect with others to participate in certain tasks. He played the role of organizer of communications. Once in his room, human beings did not immediately detect his presence and believed that the room was completely at their disposal. This gave him the opportunity for some time to follow their behavior, before the appearance of external influences changing their presence. These influences began to appear after human beings discovered that the Spider was in the same room with them.

The human being that showed the most consciousness began to indulge in meditation almost immediately after entering this room. And after the discovery of the Spider, it continued its exercises, but with the tracking of external influences emanating from the Spider. It was this feature of this human being that allowed him to establish relationships with a representative of the insect kingdom and subsequently receive valuable information that opened access to the higher layers of the common Crystal of Time. 

Usually in such rooms there are no human beings with a similar level of consciousness, since they are intended for those who are not yet ready to consciously perceive information about the work of the Spider Clan and Poppy Dominion, but are sufficiently prepared to perform certain tasks. Most likely, this conscious human being got into the premises of the Spider by mistake, as he hid rather than showed his level of consciousness. But the fact that after contact with the Spider and receiving quite specific information from him, the human being continued to study the features of the work of the Poppy Dominion and the Clan of the Spider, gives reason to believe that there was no mistake in his getting into the mentioned room. Rather, on the contrary, it got there for a more detailed study of this level of work of Poppy Dominion and for gaining a more complete knowledge of all areas of his work.

The fact that the Spider had the ability to change the characteristics of individual sections of the common Time Crystal and give them any form indicates that the described room and everything that happened in it could also be a model. The conclusions that a conscious human being made for himself allowed him to decide to continue to follow the path and achieve the goals of his integral and indivisible "I", but already having information about the work of the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan. A sufficient level of consciousness allowed this creature to gain the support of these organizations and the ability to use their inventions, such as a space-time two-way multi-channel energy-information conductor or a common database. Also, the Spider conveyed some information about the importance of certain types of work that organizations are paying attention to recently, and allowed a conscious human being to take part in them.

In addition to general and specific information about the work of organizations, Spider gave information about his participation in the work of the conveyor. Not only did he explain that he was involved in the organization of communication between industries, the workers who form them, and human beings preparing to perform certain tasks, but due to his special position, he could hold absolutely any position in the field of opium production and even lead certain areas of the Spider Clan. He showed that at any time he can appear as anyone and in any situation do everything necessary to achieve the joint goals of the two organizations, which fully transmit the orders of the Time. Having a deep knowledge of the nature of the development of the structure of the network and its functioning, he most of all felt the feelings that human beings describe as love for the sphere of establishing connection, since it reflects the nature of the web to a greater extent than others. By connecting one section of the common Time Crystal with another, the Spider formed a web, which fully corresponded to his nature.

***the Numbers***

All the activities carried out by the Spider Clan and the Poppy Dominion were stored in a common Time Crystal and received a numerical expression. The information was stored in a database that members of the Spider Clan and Poppy Dominion had access to from anywhere in the universe. The number of adepts of the Spider Clan and representatives of the Poppy Dominion, the number of new adepts, those in training, those who had any kind of encounter with opiate and in general all living beings were in the database. 

All quality processes were divided into categories and also acquired the corresponding numbers. All information was digitized and presented in the form of graphs, charts, tables and diagrams. Based on this information, Poppy Dominion made calculations. 

Initially, this type of activity was carried out by individual representatives of Poppy Dominion, but later the database was automated and a special program began to carry out all forecasts. This program, like all the previous ones related to the base, was completely digital in nature. It was based on only two digits - one and zero. Between zero, which represented the absence of something, and one, which denoted the presence, all sorts of states of information were contained. 

The General Time Crystal, which by its nature represented various forms of information connections, used three numbers - zero, one and two. Two is twice one - each is a reflection of the other. If the first is information, then the second, respectively, will be its manifestation. In the view of human beings there is no way to separate information from its manifestation, since for them information without manifestation is equal to absence of information at all.

For any living being, there is no opportunity to perceive the numerical nature of the common Crystal of Time, since this language does not exist for them. It does not exist, both for living beings with intelligence and the ability to comprehend something, and in general, in principle. This invention is the same as giving Time certain characteristics and placing it in some kind of framework. Just like Time, the language of numbers has its own unique living nature. 

The numbers live by themselves, manifest themselves independently and are not subject to the influence of any laws, except for those that Time determines for them. What human beings think of as numbers is actually not that. For lack of another opportunity to convey this manifestation of the common Crystal of Time, human beings gave the numbers a special form, and preserved everything that they could learn about numbers in the form of rules, formulas, laws and definitions. In fact, the numbers are nothing more than the ratio of individual sections of the Time Crystal to each other. But this is only the outer side of the numbers. Their inner side is a substance that determines how information will manifest itself and whether it will manifest itself at all.

The single mind of the common Crystal of Time has an independent vision, not like how the Crystal is seen by human beings. The main difference between the vision of the single mind of the common Crystal of Time, and the ways of perceiving reality by human beings is that the single mind sees the entire Crystal with all its manifestations and the processes taking place in it. Also, the one mind has in itself all the existing and ever existing visions of living beings. We can say that the common Crystal of Time sees itself, both through a single mind, and those billions of eyes and minds that living beings have. 

In view of the fact that everything that is inside the common Crystal of Time is information, the single mind of the Crystal perceives it as a combination of qualities, parameters and characteristics of individual sections, and not as a collection of forms, images and phenomena. If human beings tried to somehow imagine this vision, they would see a constantly changing multidimensional object without colors and without forms. But in view of the fact that beings cannot think without colors and without forms, they have no such possibility. 

The higher the awareness of human beings and their activity at the highest levels of the common Crystal of Time, the closer they become to the vision of the single mind of the common Crystal of Time. This process is connected with the ability of human beings to work with all the centers and bodies they have. The higher their level of work, the greater the number of their centers and bodies can work simultaneously. When at least all the centers work together, it is no longer the mind or emotions that control the processes of life, but the will, which brings human beings closer to how everything inside them is controlled by a common Crystal of Time.

The figures, to which human beings have given a certain form and meaning, are actually combinations of information cells, which, in the representation closest in nature to the human, are waves and oscillations. Combining, these waves give rise to new ones, and those further unite, acquiring a variety of qualities. All this is expressed as one number, which contains all the others. This number is one. It represents the general Crystal of Time and contains all other numbers. It is followed by the number three, which represents the active, passive and neutralizing forces that create everything within the overall Time Crystal. Next come six, twelve, twenty-four, forty-eight, and so on, up to the most gigantic and unimaginable numbers. All these figures indicate the number of orders of laws operating at different levels of a single Crystal of Time.

The way in which human beings perceive reality causes them to perceive the laws that govern the manifestations of the common Time Crystal as qualities and characteristics. At a certain level, they begin to perceive information as energy, vibrations and waves that have meaning. Further, these particles of information in the representation of human beings acquire colors and shapes. Based on their limited perception, the beings have come up with many rules that, in their opinion, control separate sections of the general Time Crystal, but these rules are actually only consequences of control, and not its causes. 

Moreover, they were only partly revealed to human beings. No human being has the ability to merge their mind with the single mind of the common Time Crystal and begin to see it in its entirety. And after the intensified work of the Poppy Dominion and the Clan of the Spider in spreading their influence, practically none of the human beings, with the exception of those who have never had any intercourse with an opiate, are moving in the direction of uniting their mind with one. This situation not only does not contribute to the development of the entire human civilization, but also plunges it into a degenerative mode of existence. Every second moves human beings away from gaining true knowledge.

The power of illusion that dominates the perception of reality by human beings gives rise to more and more delusions, which combine and create new ones. And such a situation is extremely beneficial to Poppy Dominion, and it has long had unlimited control. Moreover, no one can somehow limit this control or influence the course of policies pursued by organizations. And the fact that Poppy Dominion is directly related to Time makes its actions absolutely legal and correct within the framework of the universal balance. The situation in which the civilization of human beings lives does not in any way harm the harmonious development of the planet Earth and its relationship with other planets of the solar system. And since only the state and dynamics of the Sun correlate with other stars, then on a galaxy scale the state of the human species and even all the planets of the solar system does not matter at all.

The number of human beings born and dying is under the strict control of the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan. Their level of development always remains unchanged, there is no regression or progress. What could be called a degenerate way of being does not carry any danger. Despite the fact that human beings are gradually forgetting about the limits of decency, culture and respect, they continue to invent new types of machines and technologies. Such a situation does not contribute in any way to their internal development and gaining consciousness, but only distracts them more from what would bring them closer to the realization that Time is a Crystal. All of humanity with its inventions and innovations exists only in the form of statistics, which is reflected on a graph using a special coordinate system.

***the Coordinate System***

For a human being, the coordinate system will be the human being itself. For the general Time Crystal, the coordinate system will be the Crystal. For each system, there are several possible ways to use it. One of them can show what is happening inside the system, but cannot show what is happening outside of it. The other will show what is going on outside the system, but will not show what is going on inside. The third way will be able to show the relationship of several systems, but will not be able to show the relationship of particles within one system with particles within another. Only a method that unites several systems within itself, as well as their relationships and the relationships of particles within them, and the relationships of particles within one system with particles within another system can show the real picture. 

This way is a dynamic view of the nature of reality. It involves changing the angle of view depending on the observed level and relationships. Only the single mind of the common Time Crystal can simultaneously observe all levels of the Time Crystal and their relationships. Human beings need complex machines that will replace certain areas of their intellectual center and store the information received, presenting it in the form of graphs and tables. Otherwise, when switching attention from one level to another, human beings will forget the details, and their picture will be inaccurate. Moreover, it is extremely difficult for most human beings to maintain concentration on two objects at the same time, let alone three, four or ten. And if it is necessary to track objects and also changes in all their components at the same time, then for human beings with a low level of awareness this is not possible at all.

Due to their peculiarity of coming up with names and definitions for the manifestations of the common Crystal of Time, human beings created many symbols that not only began to be used to transmit information, but also began to display the principles of its structure. Of course, these were erroneous principles, but the zeal with which human beings sought to give all manifestations areas of the common Time Crystal of definition gradually made the symbol systems prevail over true perception. Initially, human beings recorded information through definitions. However, when these definitions were communicated, they became distorted, leading to a corresponding distortion in human beings’ perceptions of the information. Also, some systems for storing information in the form of symbols have become so complex that they have become understandable only to those who have not used any other ways of perceiving reality other than these systems. And for everyone else, they have become a mystery.

This situation allowed Poppy Dominion to successfully use various systems of information transmission in the form of symbols to spread influence through "Opium for the people". The meanings that the symbols actually possessed became known only to a limited circle of human beings who were subjected to processing and having lost the rudiments of their individuality began to unquestioningly fulfill all the requirements of Poppy Dominion. This situation made it possible to move human beings even further away from the perception of the primary meaning embedded in the symbols, and with it from the true perception of information. 

Symbol systems, which were essentially coordinate systems that allowed one to navigate within individual sections of the common Time Crystal, were initially combined. They were universal and were nothing more than a direct reflection of certain waves and frequencies that were equally perceived by all human beings. Gradually, the reflections of the waves became distorted, and along with the reflections, the perception of human beings was distorted, which forced them to share and use different languages in their communication.

In fact, each separate section of the common Time Crystal is an independent coordinate system that reflects a single system, which, in essence, is the common Time Crystal. Having a central axis and boundaries within itself, the common Crystal of Time allows you to navigate relative to its center and within existing boundaries. Also, each of its sections has its own center and boundaries, which makes it material. Even those levels of the common Crystal of Time, which appear to human beings not material, but informational, still have a similar nature. Any information has its core or quintessence, which makes it possible not only to manifest it as matter, but also to fill a certain space and time with it. Transforming from stimulating impulses and influences into real fields of activity, information fills not only the common presences of human beings, but also manifests itself as dense, material sections of the common Crystal of Time. It literally fills all the space that exists in the Crystal.

The need to correlate information units relative to each other gives rise to the nature of the coordinate system inside the Crystal. All information is correlated with respect to the centers and fields of their influences. Where there are no centers, but objects or processes still exist, there must be mixtures of fields that give rise to other centers of a different order. New centers are less dense with a lower level of manifestation of certain qualities. In relation to the first order centers, the second order centers are mixtures of information from the fields of the first order centers. But at their level, they are the most dense areas of the fields of first-order centers, which gives them the status of new centers. So orientation in space and time occurs relative to the centers of the first order and their influences. But within the overall system, each center can appear as an independent system, within which interactions of second-order centers will be monitored. 

Further, centers of the third order, the fourth, and so on ad infinitum may appear. It all depends on the boundaries you set. Borders exist only when the Time needs it, but when there is no such need, there are no borders. All coordinate systems exist simultaneously one in the other, but due to the limitations of their capabilities, human beings rarely perceive more than one of the systems. And also rarely do they live and navigate using more than one coordinate system.

***the Koba***

Those human beings who gain the ability to maintain concentration on several objects at the same time are generally considered outstanding. If they do not fall under the control of individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion or the Clan of the Spider, then sometimes they can reach a high level of awareness and gain a holistic and indivisible "I". Of course, this happens only on the condition that such beings make efforts to work on themselves. 

Otherwise, they spend all their energy studying delusions, in which they achieve some success. But if they still manage to focus on self-development, then they can notice the presence of false personalities within their common presence and get rid of them. They also sometimes manage to synchronize the work of all their centers and gain control over them, forcing them to work simultaneously. Such creatures are considered outstanding compared to others and acquire a higher status.

However, even when the work of the centers is synchronized and all false personalities are destroyed, there are still obstacles to gaining control over the situation, and these obstacles are largely created by opposing forces. Most of the obstacles come from the efforts of the Poppy Dominion to suppress the individuality of human beings and gain control over their population. If a certain human being manages to avoid clashes with a superplanetary formation called an opiate, and also does not fall into the ranks of potential adherents of the Spider Clan, then it has every chance to take advantage of its position and begin to independently spread its influence within the common Crystal of Time. 

To do this, those human beings who spend their lives to a greater extent on spreading influence, and not on studying all kinds of manifestations of the common Time Crystal, use certain information blocks that can affect the masses of other human beings and unite them. These information blocks are usually called theories or concepts. They can also bear the names of doctrines, postulates and provisions. As a rule, these are the ideas of other human beings who have created something useful for all mankind and are recognized as outstanding. Of course, such ideas cannot be beneficial to absolutely everyone, but it is not possible to admit this during the spread of one's influence, since such doubts about the usefulness of the chosen direction can repel potential adherents.

Some human beings choose other people's ideas as the basis for spreading their influence because they cannot think of anything themselves, others find other people's ideas useful and sometimes wonderful. It also happens that some human beings who make efforts to gain influence create new concepts and develop ideas themselves, but after a certain time it turns out that someone has already put forward similar ideas and even promoted them. The thing is that the vast majority of human beings, even those who have acquired a certain level of consciousness, use only the information that is contained within the common Crystal of Time. And if we take into account that all information is contained within the common Crystal of Time, it turns out that human beings always use the same information. 

Since it is not possible for the main majority of human beings to gain an understanding that Time is a Crystal and, accordingly, to sufficiently know its nature, it is necessary for them to create information blocks at least guiding human beings to gain the ability to understand individual manifestations of the common Crystal of Time. In view of the fact that such information blocks do not carry in themselves anything conducive to gaining an integral "I" and control over their centers, human beings who indulge in their study and dissemination continue to exist mechanically. Accordingly, even under the condition that all beings on planet Earth would accept for themselves one concept or doctrine as true, over time, and perhaps immediately, contradictions would form among them, which would divide them into groups with opposite opinions. And only the being that is at the head of the rest is able to monitor changes within all groups of human beings and coordinate their work, but only if there is a sufficient level of consciousness.

As a rule, the acquisition of influence associated with the dissemination of certain ideas and provisions occurs publicly and defiantly. Less often, everything happens secretly and behind the scenes. This is because it is practically impossible to involve human beings in the study and dissemination of certain ideas without communicating these ideas to these beings. It goes without saying that after the beginning of the use of oscillators by the Poppy Dominion, such a possibility appeared, and it also existed and exists when instructions are transmitted to human beings in dreams, but even in these cases certain blocks of information are communicated to human beings, albeit not directly. Communication occurs by transmitting certain frequencies and vibrations to those parts of the centers of human beings that are responsible for the connection of some centers with others. 

If usually a human being perceives information coming from the surrounding world through  senses, as well as using the functions of centers, then during the transmission of information by oscillators or through sleep, there is an impact on connections, which are sometimes called neural, and such an impact forms the work of centers without any understanding of this work. It can be said that this work appears in their common presences as naturally developed from their previous states, as if their own. But in fact, it is a consequence of a change in the state of connections between their centers. A certain atmosphere that surrounds the centers of human beings undergoes a change, and through the areas where the atmospheres of different centers mix, the relationship of these centers is formed. However, such information is usually kept in secret by Poppy Dominion, and there is no need to cover it in the vein of this narrative.

The fact that spreading influence tends to take place publicly and with the announcement of promoted positions suggests that opponents of the announced positions will always appear. And there must still be a third force that will contribute to the final victory of new or old ideas. This means that before one begins the conscious promotion of certain ideas to gain widespread or local influence, it is necessary to track the state of different groups of human beings and the moods within them. It is also necessary to track the relationship between these groups and their individual representatives. It is important to be able to calculate what further position certain groups and their members will take and how their moods will develop. All this must be combined into one common system, which should be a four-dimensional coordinate system that allows one to track the past, the present and the future of groups and their representatives, reflect all possible interactions and changes. 

This coordinate system must also take into account the impact of the ideas being promoted and how the lives of beings who accept and reject those ideas will eventually change. The presence of such a coordinate system for that human being who takes on the task of gaining influence within the common Crystal of Time and uniting other human beings through some kind of information block can determine the final outcome of the work. If the coordinate system and its possession are well developed, then the probability of success increases, and if not, then it falls. In this case, the coordinate system is the third force and determines the outcome of the struggle between the active force representing new ideas and the passive one representing old ones. 

Given the fact that for a human being, the coordinate system is always the being itself, all of the above functions of the coordinate system must be contained within the human being, who takes on the task of spreading influence. Moreover, if one human being is able to calculate and analyze the state of all human beings who will take part in the work of spreading ideas, then that person must also continue to monitor their states. And due to the fact that the number of new elements and parameters that need to be monitored will constantly grow, the dominant human being will need to constantly increase its potential and loads, which may become impossible at one moment. To overcome this impossibility of development, they will have to increase the number of their bodies, which will be occupied with different types of work, but controlled by one will. In this case, with a sufficient degree of development of the coordinate system and the skills to use it, there is the possibility of exercising constant and endless control over human beings.

The possibility of development bypassing the influences of the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan was destroyed on planet Earth so long ago that no one will remember when it existed. We can say that it never existed at all. From the moment of their inception, supra planetary formations have enveloped the planet with their influence. But their openness has become widespread not so long ago. Previously, human beings could believe that they were acting on the basis of free will and their own beliefs, but this never happened. There was always some hidden script that was communicated to them through guides or those adepts who played the role of puppeteers. In the old days, there was still no ready-made concept that could unite all human beings into one group, or even pretend to do so. 

Therefore, all control was carried out through point influences on individual human beings, whose common presence had some meaning for the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan. Over time, the influence of organizations has become ubiquitous and their methods have undergone many changes, which resulted in the open distribution of their influence. But by the time this happened, the entire planet had been under the influence of the Poppy Dominion for many centuries. The network of the Spider Clan has spread to all major metropolitan areas and the most remote centers of the globe, which has made any attempts to develop human beings bypassing the influence of these two organizations impossible. Complex schemes and strategies, designed for tens and hundreds of years ahead, actively existed and continue to exist on a planet inhabited by human beings. One such strategy was the Koba project.

It was the development of the Poppy Dominion to create a powerful master coordinate system that could be distributed throughout the globe. Along with this system, there were other systems that played the role of the main body on the part of the Spider Clan and other affiliated organizations. The coordinate system developed by the Poppy Dominion received the largest promotion and used the most reliable control methods at that time. These were methods of constantly monitoring the state of all living beings, forcibly and covertly introducing the influences of the dominant political line, as well as special methods of predicting development and preparing conditions for the accomplishment of certain events. 

Also, this system was designed to be duplicated on all other living beings. Its qualities were transmitted to everyone who was somehow connected with it, even if only by one glance at its schematic representation. Further, the vibrational characteristics embedded in the image were introduced into the general presence of the one who looked at the image of the system, and carried with them all the necessary qualities. It was necessary for the Poppy Dominion  to find out if it was possible to transfer the mode of existence of the "Koba" coordinate system to all human beings on the planet Earth. To this end, the Poppy Dominion  and the Clan of the Spider unleashed a war that swept the entire globe, leaving none of the more or less developed human civilizations unaffected. Human beings called it World War II or the Second World War, but in fact it was the peak and largest moment among the hostilities that have never stopped since the inception of relatively intelligent human life.

***the War***

All the parties that took part in the Second World War represented different coordinate systems, which, according to the Poppy Dominion and the Clan of the Spider, should have become ubiquitous among the population of the planet Earth. It was a direct order of Time, which required to bring human beings closer to the realization of the fact that Time is a Crystal, acting as a single coordinate system, which contains all objects, phenomena, events and all information. To bring human beings closer to the awareness of this phenomenon, it was necessary to unite them with one common idea and form in their common presences one single line of thinking and perception of reality. 

The "Koba" system was of the greatest interest to the Poppy Dominion, as it most suppressed the individuality of human beings and prepared them for hard work in all areas of opium production. Other systems were also focused on the total suppression of the individuality of human beings, but to a lesser extent prepared them for hard work. In this regard, it was decided to unleash a war in which the victorious side would continue to spread their ideas along with influence throughout the planet. 

The war showed that the “Koba” system was the most suitable for controlling human beings and, accordingly, it also won the war. During the time spent on finding out all the features of this system and its refinement, a lot of research and experiments were carried out, which made it possible to further distribute this system in all possible ways. But due to the peculiarity of all information blocks to become obsolete and become burdensome for control, the system, together with its fundamental concept, called communism, was first transferred to the mode of facilitated distribution, and then to the mode of covert distribution. 

To this day, it dominates all representatives of the Poppy Dominion, but the most open distribution is made by members of the Spider Clan, who began to use one of the opposing systems even before the start of the war. It was a system based on the idea of so-called democracy, which created an illusory sense of freedom in the common presences of human beings and helped them freely and as if independently fulfill all the requirements of the leadership.

During the war, one could observe the mutual performance of opposite functions between the two organizations. This way of participating in the exercise of control over human beings was developed by organizations even before the start of the war, but at the time of its activity was more visible. The Poppy Dominion acted like the Spider Clan, and the Spider Clan acted like the Poppy Dominion. The "Koba" system, developed by Poppy Dominion , was based more on mass and brutal murders and less on hypnosis, although significant attention was paid to this point. 

The Clan of the Spider acted, and still does today, as a great hypnotist, putting huge masses of human beings into a state similar to that which is caused by the use of the final or intermediate products of the opium industry. This reshuffling of working methods was created and carried out in order to hide their involvement in the events taking place on planet Earth to a greater extent.

***the Nuclear Bomb***

The heightened awareness of concealing one's participation in the organization of events that took place during the Second World War and what happened after it was associated with new types of weapons that became widespread at that time. The most perfect and most massive murder weapon at that time was the nuclear bomb, research on the creation of which was actively conducted during the war and was completed after. When the developments were completed and the bomb was created, the Spider Clan applied it to human beings that inhabited some areas of the globe. 

Enough human beings were killed for the survivors to deviate substantially from the ideological course pursued by the party that dropped the nuclear bomb. Therefore, in order to maintain their power, the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan switched their methods until the bomb was ready. When it became ready, everything returned to its place again.

The Spider Clan carried out the biggest and the most brutal massacres in history, demonstrating their power to the whole world. Subsequently, the nuclear bomb and other weapons of mass destruction were also obtained by the Poppy Dominion, but transcendental methods of controlling the general presence of human beings gained the greatest popularity.

The nuclear bomb has become not only the most powerful weapon in the world, but also the most powerful symbol. A single image or snapshot of a nuclear explosion evoked feelings of fear and unquestioning submission in the common presences of human beings. These photographs and artistic images became gestalts. To a greater extent, the photographs were gestalt, and among them the highest degree of influence was acquired by those that were filmed from the cameras installed on the airplanes that dropped the atomic bombs.

The technique of transferring the influences of a weapon to its image was developed by the Spider Clan back in those days when the main weapon of murder and intimidation was a sharpened knife poisoned with a spider venom. And during the use of nuclear weapons, individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan ordered their slaves to take many pictures of nuclear bomb explosions, for which, of course, they needed to blow up a certain number of these deadly machines. 

The Poppy Dominion and the Clan of the Spider again acquired many gestalts, which began to spread everywhere and transmit the required influences to human beings. Despite the fact that nuclear bombs no longer exploded, human beings still thought about them and were constantly focused on them. In many public places, posters were hung with real pictures of nuclear explosions and attached messages. This combination made it possible to induce in human beings an effect similar to the state obtained from the use of the final or intermediate products of the opium industry, and to keep them in this state for a long time. Being in the described position, human beings became incredibly suggestible and susceptible to influence, which made it possible to transmit commands to them through simple captions attached to photographs of nuclear explosions.

Of course, a huge number of photographs of the consequences of these explosions were obtained, but the photographs of the so-called nuclear mushroom acquired the greatest influence and distribution, which caused sensations more similar to those obtained from the use of the final or intermediate products of the opium industry. This explosion, even in its shape, resembled a ripe box of opium poppy. And the way it conveyed the moment of the development of the effect obtained from the use of the final or intermediate products of the opium industry does not need comments. 

This degree of closeness is due to the fact that at that time all opiates gave a product of the highest quality. At the same time, first-class weapons were developed that carried out massacres. Such a ratio of seemingly unrelated things at first glance was due to the fact that during this period the section of the common Crystal of Time, in which the planet Earth is located, was subject to certain influences that came from other sections of the common Crystal. These influences were caused by the approach of the planets and the activity of the stars that were near the planet Earth. The planets and stars acquired these influences from a higher level, and those from a still higher level. 

Accordingly, initially the influences that forced the appearance of nuclear weapons on Earth, reflecting the opiate and its effects to a sufficiently high degree, were direct orders of Time. These orders were received by the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan directly from Time and put into practice. From this position, the Spider Clan and Poppy Dominion cannot be accused of excessive cruelty, since they carried out the direct orders of the Time. And for Time, there is no such thing as cruelty at all, because inside its common Crystal everything is balanced and is the result of the transition of information from a light form to a coarser one. Everything is subject to laws that determine how information will acquire its dense material form, and in what areas of the common Time Crystal this will happen.

If somewhere there was information that the Spider Clan should destroy a sufficiently large number of human beings with a nuclear bomb, then somewhere else before that there was an overabundance of manifestations of the common Time Crystal that were opposite in nature, which needed to be balanced. Due to the fact that everything is done only as it seems possible and as efficiently as possible, the method described above was chosen, which acquired the ultimate degree of materialization with all the ensuing consequences. 
Those beings who died as a result of the actions being carried out, and those who performed these actions, had no opportunity to avoid this situation and, moreover, did not bear any responsibility for this situation, because they did not have a sufficient measure of consciousness. All their behavior was purely mechanical and entirely formed by Time. 

External influences that came to the planet Earth only to get to the Moon, for a long time formed the circumstances, created the conditions and ultimately gave rise to a bloody massacre, culminating in the most massive murder of human beings on the planet. Together with this tragic final for human beings, the influences were transferred to the Moon and completed their cycle.

***the Zulfiqar***

All rotating cosmic bodies are manifestations of Time. For human beings, this Time has more to do with lighting and climate change. It is also associated with the moon and its phases. Time itself represents the crystallization of certain laws that form worlds of different orders. Each of these worlds has its own relative time. For the stars it is one, for the planets it is another, for people it is the third, and for the common Crystal it is the totality of all possible forms and manifestations. Despite the fact that at each of the levels of the common Crystal, Time can be a unique system, it still remains the same and unchanged.

The thing is that, regardless of the order of the manifested world, time is always a reflection of the common and unified Time and can’t help but be such. Nothing within the common Crystal of Time can not reflect it to one degree or another. Everything depends on the degree of proximity of the manifestation of individual sections to the center of the common Crystal and on the degree to which these sections are filled with meaning. In other words, some areas of the common Crystal reflect its nature to a greater extent, and some to a lesser extent. Some areas convey most of the nature of the overall Crystal, while others convey only a small part. 

Also an important role is played by the degree of dependence of individual sections of the common Crystal of Time on the laws that govern the world of a given order. In the case when a section of a common Crystal is subject to many laws, it manifests itself mechanically to a greater extent and is extremely dependent on the surrounding world. Such a site reflects the nature of a single Crystal to a lesser extent, but it is also impossible to say that it is somehow different from it. It's just that such a site does not have a sufficient level of consciousness to correspond to the nature of Time. This may be a highly organized and complex organism, or even a whole group of organisms, but they will not have even a grain of consciousness. They are part of a system necessary to maintain the overall functioning of the larger life form in which they reside. This is comparable to the life of a cell inside an organism.

Despite the fact that the cell is quite complex and performs a series of functions that require a strategic approach, it does not have consciousness, but only serves as a tool for achieving the goals of the organism of which it is a part. The same beings or sections of the common Crystal of Time, which are sometimes freed from the influence of a certain number of laws that operate at their level, can begin to act regardless of the number of laws that they were able to avoid. These creatures cease to act mechanically, they escape from the influence of the environment and cease to perform unnecessary activity. Sometimes such beings are able to perform what are called miracles. Such phenomena are caused by the manifestation of laws of a higher order at levels of a lower order. One of these miracles was the Zulfiqar.

In view of the special circumstances once formed under the influence of Time, one human being was able to acquire some level of consciousness that allowed this individual to perform what other human beings called miracles. Even though this being became quite independent from surrounding circumstances and gained influence among other human beings, it could not completely escape the control of the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan. However, it received a pre-eminent status for the entire subsequent existence of the planet Earth, and its doctrine was retained to maintain human beings in a certain state. 

Such an incredible and impossible for most human beings respect from the side of the Poppy Dominion and the Clan of the Spider was shown to this Man, due to his high degree of determination and ability to perform feats comparable to miracles. At that time, few people could boast of the same restraint and confidence in the correctness of their ideas. And the fact that no one at the same time acted at the same level of consciousness confirms the exclusivity of this human being. The greatest of the miracles performed by this Man was the creation of a certain book, which to this day has an effect on human beings somewhat similar to the effect obtained from the use of the final or intermediate products of the opium industry.

The difference between this book and other manifested sections of the common Crystal of Time, which have the ability to transfer vibrational characteristics into the common presences of human beings, lies in the fact that this book, like the well-known section of the common Crystal, has not only the ability to completely suppress the individualities of human beings, but also gives them a lot of useful effects. These effects can be healing, they can be in the nature of insight, and they can also open readers' abilities such as clairvoyance, telepathy, the ability to open and close doors in the corridors of Time, and sometimes use spatial portals and space-time two-way multi-channel energy-informational conductors. 

Of course, for the bulk of human beings, this book does not bring any positive results, except for complete oblivion and supposedly independent submission to an additional volume of laws. But sometimes, by special order of the Time, this book turns those who have encountered it into real sages, possessing a holistic and indivisible "I" and well-coordinated work of centers. This happens extremely rarely and far from being because someone has read the mentioned book, but because the conditions previously prepared by the Time have ripened for this. If a human being did not resist and did not make mistakes in behavior, then they got the opportunity to move from their level of development to the next level along with the movement of influences. Sometimes for such a transition a push is needed, which can appear from outside and must have a strictly defined character. Such shocks were produced by Zulfiqar, which was another well-known miracle associated with the personality of the special human being mentioned above.

Zulfiqar was a sword that was not subject to some of the laws in force on the planet Earth. This sword in the hands of its owner had remarkable strength and could hang in the air. It literally stayed where the owner mentally left it. From there, it could instantly fall into its master's hand when required. Considering that everything on the planet Earth has a property called attraction, then the ability of this sword to hang in the air seemed really incredible to others. The one who possessed this sword knew how such an ability was achieved. He knew this through the experience of what could be called union with the common Time Crystal. This unification allowed to begin to convey the nature of the common Crystal to a greater extent, as well as to gain more knowledge about other sections.

This form of connection with the common Time Crystal allowed a living being to begin to change some parts of the common Time Crystal by its own will. But the being in question did not change the nature of individual sections of the common Crystal of Time, but only transmitted the orders of Time, as the angels once did. It conveyed them through suggestion and persuasion. Some human beings listened to him and joined his path, while others rejected him and entered into military confrontations with him. In these battles, Zulfiqar manifested itself and always brought victory to his given owner. 

This sword possessed some degree of consciousness, inherited from the shared Time Crystal. This allowed the sword to generate a powerful energy field around it, which protected the borders of the entire world, which was formed by a conscious human being who had Zulfikar with him. Subsequently, realizing his susceptibility to the influence of Time and the imminent possibility of disintegration into constituent elements, Zulfikar carved its image in one of the stone slabs. It previously smeared itself with poison and performed the work with an extreme degree of concentration. The sword did it without the help of the Man, on its own, as Time commanded it. Its entire existence on the planet was connected with the human being who had it in his possession. And the stone slab with the imprint of the poisoned Zulfiqar was further used to create many copies of its images, which are used to this day.

Zulfiqar passed itself like a sword with two blades. It was this design that allowed it to overcome many of the laws in force on the planet Earth, including the law of gravity. A special attraction was formed between the two blades, which pumped up energy in this place and distorted space and sometimes Time. A clot of pure energy replaced the physical center or axis present in any material object. So this sword received a dual nature. It was material and non-material at the same time, which was originally laid down and reflected in its form. The two blades indicated the presence of not only a sword that dealt physical damage, but also a sword that dealt psychic damage. This sword had the ability to push the centers of human beings and their general presence to move to another level, sometimes higher and sometimes lower. The way the sword behaved was determined by the influence of a third force, which was sometimes Time, and sometimes the owner of the sword.

***the Demons***

The short stay of human beings in the same room with the Spider was the beginning of serious changes that followed in their lives. For the Spider, this time was not so significant, nor did it carry anything new or surprising, since everything was calculated and analyzed by him in advance. He not only spent a certain period of Time on a preliminary study of the characteristics of the vital and mental activity of human beings, who later got into his room, but also made certain efforts to influence them and change their behavior. The way the Spider did this became clear only after leaving him and not to all the human beings, who were in the same room with him. That human being who possessed a sufficient level of consciousness, after parting with the Spider, was able to understand many things and discover the presence of the influences of the Spider in his life even before entering the premises of the latter.

One of those things was the fact that after the apparent parting with the Spider, the human being actually did not separate from him. Both before and after meeting the real Spider in one of the rooms of the corridor, built to meet the needs of the Poppy Dominion’s conveyor, the Spider appeared in the lives of human beings in the form of a certain set of people acting together. The illusion of separation of the surrounding world makes human beings perceive the objects around them in the form of objects separated from each other by space. Also, human beings see their own kind as separately acting individuals. In reality, there is only one object and only one subject. And there is no division into the observer and the observed, but there is only a single process of manifestation. The only object that exists in the universe is the total Time Crystal, whose mind is the only subject. If there were a division between the observer and the observed, then one could say that a single mind observes a common Time Crystal. But this does not happen and cannot happen.

The Spider, being as close as possible to Time, reflects the nature of the common Time Crystal to a high enough degree. He does not act as an entity separated from the whole world and living on his own, but as a conscious part of the overall Time Crystal, which controls many processes and beings simultaneously on the basis of its free will. His will has the ability to control the spread of influences within the shared Time Crystal. 

Sometimes the Spider can contribute to the spread of certain influences, and sometimes it can limit their spread. It also has the ability to produce thrusts that will shift some of the influences to a higher or lower note in the octave when needed. When human beings, who do not have a sufficient measure of consciousness, cannot resist external influences and mechanically receive and transmit them, they are completely dependent on these influences, which form the basis of human life. But if a human being does have a certain degree of awareness, then when the Spider interferes in their life, it becomes possible to trace some special influences that have never been there before. 

Of course, the Spider himself chooses who to leave such an opportunity, and who should not have it. This is determined by whether the human being is ready to accept further the existence of such influences in life or not. If their general presence is sufficiently developed, and it is of some value to the Spider Clan, then the being has the opportunity to notice the presence of a higher intelligence in their life. This supermind controls processes beyond the control of a human being, moreover, it is able to completely control the masses of human beings, forcing them to perform, at first glance, unrelated tasks in order to achieve one goal known only to it.

The fact that human beings who live in the illusory division of the whole world into parts do not have the ability to realize the existence of a common Time Crystal makes it impossible for them to also notice the presence of a single mind of a common Crystal. If such an opportunity existed, then they would be able to notice how all the ongoing processes within the common Crystal of Time express by their presence the manifestation of this Crystal. It is absolutely impossible for human beings to notice the presence of a single mind, but, fortunately, and sometimes, unfortunately for them, there are other, larger than human minds that combine many beings and processes into single organisms. 

Such minds embody some of the ideas that existed even before the development of the life of human beings. These could be the ideas of freedom, evolution, goodness, or they could be the ideas of death, power and violence. Such ideas, sometimes called archetypes, spread within the common presences of human beings long before they were even born. They were there even before human beings began to communicate with the help of sounds. Even then, something united them into groups and forced them to adhere to a certain way of behavior.

Subsequently, based on the results obtained from the life of these creatures, united by one idea, the archetypes were combined into some clearer formations, making groups of living beings more pronounced, with clearer differences and positions. If, for example, there was one group of human beings united by the idea of violence, and another group united by the idea of controlling others, then united, they could act on the basis of the idea of power through violence. An uninitiated layman will say that this idea appeared as a result of the activity of human beings, but in fact this activity of human beings developed as a result of the union of two archetypes that existed in them long before their own appearance. These archetypes existed even before the appearance of human beings and any other beings in general. They were present as certain forms of information within the common Crystal of Time and fought to spread their influence within the entire space of the Crystal.

Which of the so-called ideas at a certain moment dominates inside the common Crystal of Time determines the nature of the flow of all processes inside the common Crystal. One can detect the presence of separate ideas within the Crystal only as a result of perceiving the illusion of its separation. In fact, a single mind combines all possible ideas and archetypes, clearly distributing their influence and control over certain areas of the common Crystal. 

Moreover, for a single mind there are no ideas or archetypes, but only the presence of the manifestation of certain laws of Time, which, as a result of their greater or lesser manifestation in separate sections of the common Crystal of Time, form what is then called characteristics or qualities or simply information. This information takes on all sorts of forms and images. It appears mechanically, without initiative and without motivation. Everything is ordered and there is no visible chaos, but there is only a single process of manifestation of the common Crystal of Time.

It is impossible for an ordinary human being to detect the presence of such a high organization in the world. The only thing it can do is to detect some higher levels of organization in relation to its own, but even these will not fully reflect the nature of the overall Time Crystal. The presence of the influences of archetypes or of some ideas which, in the process of their development, spread within the presences of many human beings, makes it possible to understand the nature of the formation of these so-called higher organizations. Their structures are formed on the basis of a combination of ideas that shape the behavior of human beings within these organizations and their relationships with others. But with respect to the archetypes, even though one has been able to notice their independence, there is no possibility of an absolutely exact or identical coincidence of their influence within the presences of several human beings. Some human beings express the influences of the archetypes in one way, and others in a very different way. Of course, there is a certain similarity in the manifestations, but not one hundred percent.

How the association of ideas called the Clan of the Spider developed is beyond doubt. It was based on the archetype of death, which later joined the archetypes of murder, violence, power, deceit, cunning and others. And after connecting with the Poppy Dominion, archetypes of hypnosis, trance, poison, addiction, submission and some others were added. Such a strong mixture immediately made the influence of the two organizations limitless. Archetypes such as addiction and death existed even before the birth of some cosmic objects and served as the basis for the life of galaxies. These galaxies had to die, and they were dependent on Time. Accordingly, such information has always been present within the common presences of human beings.

Possessing knowledge about the nature of the development of his organization and about how the life of human beings developed, the Spider easily determined which archetypes currently dominate both in the general mass of human beings and among its individual representatives. Having determined where, when and how certain laws of the common Time Crystal would manifest themselves, the Spider adjusted the selected section of the common Time Crystal in advance for the purposes of the Clan. If he did not have enough time to prepare the selected area, he returned to the past and made changes there, and sometimes he simply stopped Time and did everything necessary. In the arsenal of his techniques for controlling individual sections of the common Time Crystal, there were as many techniques as there could be. Also, the number of new techniques was constantly increasing, but not all of them were used.

Techniques appeared along with the emergence of the possibility of accomplishing certain events within the common Crystal. But there was no need for the Spider to use them, since the well-established and classical schemes for changing space, time and the general presences of human beings over the years were perfect. The way the Spider appeared to human beings in the form of different representatives of their species at one moment did not leave them a chance to notice any external influence. Everything seemed to happen as mechanically as it had always been. But it was a game. The Spider, having unlimited influence over the adepts of the Clan, used them to directly control their common presences through the simultaneous distribution of influences to their various centers. He created certain vibrations that were transmitted to human beings and made them behave the way he needed.

At one and the same moment, the Spider had the ability to hold several thousand human beings. They all acted as a single unit, performing completely different tasks. The number of tasks could exceed hundreds of thousands for a group of a thousand human beings. Each of them could do a hundred tasks for the Spider and not notice it. The spider achieved this control by dividing the identities of human beings into many separate selves. These false identities lurked within the one presence of a human being and could change every second. And with them, the tasks that the Spider sent to human beings also changed. But sending takes time, and the Spider did not waste it. Just because it is not possible for human beings to perceive the common Crystal of Time literally, the ways of spreading influences are described in terms of vibrations and fluctuations, when by their nature they are strengthening or weakening the influences of the laws of Time.

It was not necessary for the Spider to generate and send waves through space, as his consciousness, more merged with the mind of the shared Time Crystal, filled most of the shared Time Crystal. It was enough for him to shift his attention from one area to another and increase or decrease the influence of certain laws, and the selected area of the Crystal immediately changed. The Spider could either make changes instantly or stretch them out in Time, setting a course for the accomplishment of certain events. And, of course, he could change the past. Thus the Spider shaped the development of legions of false personalities in the presences of human beings, in parallel preparing instructions for them for every second of their subsequent lives. He did this in conjunction with the Poppy Dominion, making extensive use of its methods to suppress the individuality of human beings. It got to the point that after a certain period of time, within the common presences of some human beings, from one to several hundred thousand personalities were formed, which changed every second and did something different all the time.

All tasks were pre-planned by the Spider and the Poppy Dominion and implemented into the presence of human beings along with instructions. Quite often, these were brutal tasks that were of such a varied nature that other human beings, who watched them being performed, called those, who were recruited and processed by the Spider Clan, as possessed. This view was shaped in part by the influence of what has come to be called "The Opium for the People" and in part by the admixture of external influences. 

Some human beings, as a result of interaction with such a formation as religion, have acquired some ideas regarding the cruel manifestations of the common Time Crystal. These manifestations were given the name of demons, who allegedly possessed consciousness and deliberately committed atrocities, obeying their dominant body, which they began to call the devil.

After the emergence of such ideas, everything that human beings considered evil and insidious began to be attributed to the devil. This was extremely beneficial to the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan, as it further concealed their involvement in the activity that existed on the planet Earth. Over time, certain individuals appeared among human beings, who were engaged in the study of these demons and their destruction, but, of course, they did not produce anything other than an even greater spread of delusions. None of these human beings have been able to get rid of even one false personality, which they called a demon. Indulging in various activities designed to rid human beings of demons, they only multiplied the number of false personalities within their common presence and strengthened their positions, thereby depriving themselves of the opportunity to acquire a whole and indivisible "I".

This state of affairs contributed to the spread of the influence of the Poppy Dominion, since quite often false personalities forced human beings to acquire the final or intermediate products of the opium industry, which, of course, was built into them in advance. As a result of such manipulations, the entire opium industry was classified as what was called demonism, and this finally destroyed in the presence of human beings the possibility of detecting the involvement of the Poppy Dominion  and the Clan of the Spider in the events taking place on the planet. For individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion and the Clan of the Spider, the opportunity to indicate their presence has been and is still being preserved. 

Moreover, sometimes representatives of these organizations take advantage of their opportunity and declare their total control over one or another section of the common Time Crystal. If someone is able to accept their statement, then most likely he will not hesitate to give up, and if not, then after the statement, mass and most brutal murders and total suppression of individuals in a variety of ways often follow. Sometimes the disclosure of one’s nature to some human beings who have a strong enough desire to acquire an integral and indivisible “I” and have achieved certain successes on the way to this, and also, to one degree or another, have not fallen under the influence of supra planetary formations called opiate, and have not lost their individuality occurs through a series of hints or signs. It is precisely such hints and signs, indicating the presence of a higher mind, that a conscious human being discovered in his life after staying in the same room with the Spider.

Such events occur extremely rarely, or rather they do not occur at all. This is due to the fact that for a long time now all human beings on the planet Earth have been under the total control of the Poppy Dominion and have not the slightest chance of gaining individuality and a holistic "I". How it happened that this human being had the inclinations to acquire an integral and indivisible "I", and also had already achieved considerable success in getting rid of false personalities and did not lose his individuality during his life, was known to a very limited circle of living beings. The Spider knew about it, individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion, of course, the Time, and, in part, the creature itself knew this. He did not know everything exactly, since, despite its successes associated with gaining consciousness, it still did not gain the ability to fully experience and transmit the entire nature of the common Crystal of Time. However, he knew enough to be able to communicate with the Spider and be respected. 

Among what he knew about the general Time Crystal was much related to the nature of networking and Time processes, influences and their categories, ways of suppressing individuality and gaining it, and also other useful information was contained within its general presence. But the most useful possession of this human being was the ability to sometimes connect his mind with the manifestations of the single mind of the common Crystal of Time and, at least for a short period of Time, acquire integral knowledge.

Most likely, it was this ability from the very beginning of its existence that was inside the general presence of a human being that saved him from the total suppression of individuality caused by the Poppy Dominion. Such an opportunity gave this human being the right to all the advantages of kinship with Time. This relationship was known to all representatives of the Poppy Dominion, the Spider Clan and, of course, the Time. The human being himself discovered this kinship only after encountering such a highly organized mind as the mind of the Spider, which reflected the Time to a high enough degree. This encounter allowed him to see and understand that everything he did in his life was justified and pre-planned by the Time. Also, a certain degree of freedom was left in the life of this human being, allowing him to manage his life in accordance with his desires. 

In those moments when the being was given over to the fulfillment of his own desires, which were more due to the normal development of his general presence, and not due to a mechanical reaction to external influences, he received some signs of the presence of a higher intelligence, to a certain extent governing his life.

At first glance,these signs came from outside unrelated human beings. Only after meeting and communicating with the Spider, it became clear that the Spider makes them carry out certain assignments, sometimes through influence, and sometimes through the development of false personalities in them. Having given the human being a preliminary understanding of his existence, the Spider at the time of the meeting immediately began to discuss and clarify the most important and significant issues that prepared this human being to perform very serious and responsible tasks of the Time.

***the Seals***

The structure of the overall Time Crystal can be conveyed through one or a series of symbols reflecting its fundamental laws. These symbols can cause certain vibrations in the general presence of the one who observes them, which will push the observer to experience the Truth. The laws that exist within the common Crystal of Time and determine the nature of its manifestations are also conditioned by laws of a different order. In other words, some laws form others, those create the next order and so on.

The very first law is the law of the common Time Crystal. It combines everything that can exist into a single structure within which everything happens. This is the Crystal level of the highest order. For a human being there is no way to track the existence of this level, since for them it is practically non-material. But this is only a consequence of limited perception, when in fact this level is as material as everything else, but has its own unique nature. Despite the inability to perceive the highest level of the overall Time Crystal, it is possible to represent this level as a symbol.

This symbol is a dot. It contains all other symbols and forms, but it lacks them as well. In order for a point to begin to convey the influences of the highest level of a common Crystal, it must be depicted separately from everything or independently. It is also necessary to prepare one's perception and common presence to face the effects of perception of the highest level of the common Time Crystal. This way of conveying various influences through symbols is very similar to the coordinate systems that govern the lives of human beings, but it is different and was available only to a limited number of living beings. This method allows someone who owns information and has reached a sufficient level of awareness to transfer unlimited amounts of information and energy of various qualities through a portal that has received a special name.

Such a portal is a seal, which is essentially a set of symbols enclosed in a circle. But not every seal is a portal and, moreover, a portal that transmits an unlimited amount of energy and information. Many of the human beings have encountered seals in their daily work, but these were seals of a different kind, they only transmitted an extremely low and insignificant amount of information without active energy. 

These human seals were usually used to confirm the truth of some documents or objects. Such a limited way of using seals arose as a result of a distortion of information about the direct purpose of the portals. Initially, any seal carried the ability to change space and sometimes time. Such a seal was a source of energy used by relatively conscious beings to create something. Those who had knowledge of the correct use of the seal could lay down an algorithm for the spread of influences and the activity of laws within a selected area of the general Time Crystal and thereby change it. This became possible because the symbols, properly matched to each other, uniting their vibrations in the language of human beings, but in fact strengthening or weakening the influences of the laws of the common Crystal of Time, become conductors of influences and laws of a higher order. This allows one to cancel the laws in force at their level and change the selected area of the overall Time Crystal.

There are some features associated with the compilation of those seals that will allow strictly defined manipulations. These features limit the effect of seals through the state of the environment. In other words, under certain conditions the seal will transmit the required influences, while under others it will not. Such seals were the most common on Earth, because due to their peculiarity of perceiving the common and single Time Crystal as many separate parts, human beings often could not put everything that is a common Time Crystal into the seal, but put only parts. 

There are also seals that carry the influence of absolutely everything that is inside the common Crystal of Time. Such a seal can serve as a dot in a circle. These two symbols represent space and time. The point conveys the existence of all possible matter, and the circle conveys the presence of the nature of time, which determines the manifestation of this matter. 

For human beings, this symbol received the erroneous meaning of the Sun with its orbit. This is due to the fact that only a limited number of human beings who have experienced the highest level of the overall Time Crystal and the consequences of its existence in one way or another can perceive the seal, consisting of a dot in a circle, as a portal that transmits the influences of the highest level of the general Time Crystal. For everyone else, there is simply no opportunity to work with a portal of this level, since there is nothing inside their common presences that would push them to perceive this information and energy.

Most likely, for most human beings, the top of what they can directly perceive is the solar system. That is why for them the dot in the circle reflects this level of the common Crystal and nothing else. In order to extract the maximum useful energy and information from the seal, it is necessary that such an opportunity exists in advance within the general presence of the one who uses the seal. 

It is necessary to have a holistic and indivisible "I", as well as an understanding that Time is a Crystal and knowledge of the laws of its manifestation. Only if the required combination of information is contained within the total presence of a human being, can this being extract an unlimited amount of information and energy from the seal. Interaction is entirely determined by the level of development of a human being. If their general presence is not developed, then even if they have the most complete and powerful seal at their disposal, they will not be able to use it, but a developed and conscious being can extract an incommensurable amount from the simplest seal.

A similar situation developed when the Spider and one of the human beings, who was in the room with him, observed a burning match. With a high level of consciousness, they could observe eternity and colossal power inside the smallest manifestation of fire. This opportunity grants the energy of all the fire that is inside the common Crystal of Time and access to information about everything that contains this matter. In the case of seals, it is possible to receive information and energy of absolutely any quality in any of the sections of the common Time Crystal. All that is needed is to know the required character combinations and how to work with them.

The principles of working with seals were developed by Poppy Dominion for the direct transmission of the orders of the Time in their circles. This method of communication was never intended for human beings, so almost none of them ever gained the full ability to use seals. The Poppy Dominion used seals as an element contributing to the activation of the spatio-temporal bilateral multi-channel energy-informational conductor. While maintaining concentration on the same seal within their common presences, individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion, even being in different parts of the common Crystal of Time, still do not lose touch with each other and can transmit information over great distances and at different time and also send opium through the portals they create.

The Seal of the Poppy Dominion, available to all its representatives without exception, contains all the information and energy available to the Poppy Dominion related to Time. The ability to extract energy and information from the press is determined by the level of development of individual representatives of Poppy Dominion. Of course, no human being with a completely suppressed individuality has even the smallest level of access to this seal. The Spider Clan, in the same way, has its own version of the seal. This is a direct reflection of the seal of Poppy Dominion. These two systems together are a manifestation of the common Crystal of Time and its laws and are essentially the same, but differ in appearance.

***the Dust***

During communication with a conscious human being, the Spider gave him the form of the seal of his Clan, which allowed the human being to subsequently remain in constant communication with the Clan. This opportunity opened up access to the past of the Clan, which helped to discover the influence of the Clan on the life of a given human being in the past. It was thanks to this seal that the Spider had the ability to control space and time. It can be said that wherever this seal was manifested, space and time acted according to the laws laid down in it. And the print carrier became a direct transmitter of the orders of the Time, in other words, it performed its functions.

This seal was not expressed materially in any way. More precisely, it was material, but had no visible expression for human beings. The Spider contained all its elements within itself and conveyed their influences to each separate part of the Time of its indivisible existence. In fact, the Spider itself was a seal and this was the only way that opened unlimited access to it. Only by experiencing all the possible manifestations of the common Crystal of Time contained in the seal through your own existence, can you gain complete control over it. 

More precisely, there is the possibility of direct access to what is embedded in the seal. But the human being, in the absence of the opportunity to immediately and completely experience all the possible manifestations of the common Time Crystal, enclosed in the seal of the Spider Clan, received it in the form of a graphic and symbolic representation in order to further explore it and learn how to use it to the fullest. Gradually, the need for the existence of a seal pattern disappeared, and the creature was able to maintain concentration on this seal with all its general presence, which also made it a semblance of a seal. But this did not happen immediately, and before it happened, the seal was only dust stuck together, which had in itself only the rudiments of integrity.

For all human beings who do not have information about the fact that Time is a Crystal, the world appears as a collection of the smallest particles ordered by some physical laws. These particles have neither consciousness nor any information contained in them, which makes them, in the view of human beings, the most ordinary dust. This view of the nature of reality is due to the fact that most human beings themselves are dust. They see themselves the same way they see the world around them and believe that they are subject to the same laws. 

In fact, they are subject to the same laws as the whole world, but only their idea of the world and, accordingly, of themselves is not something that is not complete, but even to the smallest extent is not true. Everything they can see is an illusion, and everything they understand is a delusion. This situation turns each of them into a point filled with nothing but the same useless points. This fact makes everything they see the same useless point in their perception. Together, these human beings and the world around them simply form that dust.

Unlimited power over such dust is possessed by any member of the Spider Clan or Poppy Dominion, capable of transmitting the influences of the seal. For them, all this dust, which has the illusion of form, can be turned into its original form from many unconnected points in a moment and rebuilt into something new that has meaning or need for them. Giving free energy, the seal carrier destroys the surrounding world. Further, he or she transfers the influence of the seal of broken matter, and when it becomes ready, turns it into something new, commensurate with the given free energy. This is how the principle of equal exchange is manifested, which also plays an important role in the construction of the common Crystal of Time. 

Other seals can destroy the structure of space and also the structure of Time. To do this, the carrier needs to break the flowing Time into many separate particles or segments in order to change some of them later. But this ability is available to an extremely limited circle of people and any information about it is not subject to disclosure.

***the Bulb***

Those human beings who do not have the ability to perceive the common Time Crystal as a whole, very often have an overestimated self-esteem, if it can be called that, and an extremely overestimated and unreasonable sense of self-importance. Despite the fact that their sciences have not yet proved any essential importance of the existence of organic life on Earth, the beings tend to consider themselves important and significant. Many of them are of the opinion that they are the highest link in the development of life and tend to belittle all other species. In addition, the science of human beings states that even if all living beings disappear from the face of the Earth, the planet will still be able to continue its normal existence. Such an opinion, contained in their common presences, is due to a sufficiently high degree of stupidity and not knowing anything of what is objective truth.

This particular view of life not only greatly helps the Poppy Dominion and the Clan of the Spider to spread their influence, but is also welcomed, as it is most conducive to the destruction of any manifestations of individuality and aspirations for its acquisition. The desire to appear significant makes human beings even more mechanical than they are and subject them to even more laws. These laws manifest themselves in the form of influences that are in the last stage of the penultimate stage of their development. In other words, these are descending influences that have already passed the Earth and are ready to move on to the Moon.

It is the Moon that compels human beings to act less deliberately and more mechanically. So it is beneficial for the Moon that human beings kill each other as often as possible and commit more catastrophes than usual. All the energy released as a result of these processes is sent to the moon and settles there. On the Moon, it is no longer positive or negative, but simply nourishing and helps it grow and develop. Thus, all the atrocities that occur on Earth could be called the conditioned desires of the Moon, if they were not direct orders of Time. 

And the Moon for Time is nothing more than a tool for achieving certain goals. But even the Moon, which contributes to the manifestation of everything evil and negative on Earth, cannot be compared in terms of the level of selfishness with some individual representatives of the species of human beings. And sometimes even with groups of human beings. Despite the fact that all selfishness, vanity and pride in this living matter are provoked to a large extent by the Moon, they surpass the source that gave birth to them in terms of their level of development. It is as unbelievable as it is unbelievable for a son to be physically older than his father.

Atheists, as they are sometimes called by human beings who believe in some form of "Opium for the People", tend to generally believe that there is no contradiction in the fact that they will achieve their selfish goals by absolutely any means. They do not even suspect that most of their methods often move them away from their own goals, rather than bring them closer. For them, not only does there not exist unity between different sections of the common Crystal of Time, laws, balance, influences, Time, but for them there is not even any information that something in this world is done in accordance with the calculations. For such human beings, there is only their meager selfishness that dominates the mind. 

The desire to possess something forces them to commit such stupid and unjustified actions that they are even ready to destroy the whole world in order to achieve their goal. It is strange that they do not understand that when the world is destroyed, there will not be what they so badly wanted to have. However, this does not prevent them from creating their own destruction.

What is of interest in the context of this narrative is the fact that neither false personalities, nor external influences, nor the Moon, nor the Poppy Dominion and neither the Clan of the Spider, nor anything that governs practically everything in the universe, has anything to do with such manifestations of the impenetrable stupidity of human beings. It's almost impossible, but it's true. 

Even time has never contained and cannot contain such qualities, although it contains absolutely all the qualities that can exist. In this situation, the question of the origin of such qualities is logical. The answer to this question is as simple as ever. Human beings acquire these qualities as a result of not remembering themselves. They cannot observe themselves and cannot follow the development of certain qualities within their common presences. 

In addition to the fact that they do not have the opportunity to do this, they also do not have the opportunity to find out about it from somewhere. This hopeless situation has nothing to do with anything that governs the universe. It is also not a consequence of the manifestation of any laws. This is a consequence of the lack of attention and desire to work on oneself. Just the fact that there is a lack of attention in human beings could be attributed to Poppy Dominion. But it began to deal with the suppression of attention, along with the suppression of individuality, when it was no longer present in the presences of human beings. Or it wasn't there yet. In any case, Poppy Dominion was not the first to steal the attention of human beings. Most likely, they themselves were initially to blame for the absence of attention. And with it, they irretrievably lost the possibility of remembering themselves.

This feature makes them like an incandescent lamp, which claims to shine itself, and which denies the existence of a source of electricity and does not want to see the wires that bring energy to it. This lamp is convinced that there is only light coming from it and there is no other light. It does not believe that it itself is a reflection of the heavenly bodies that existed before its appearance. Does not believe in the existence of any laws that govern its activity. Does not know about the switch and that it can burn out. 

It is an arrogant, tiny source of light that very often considers itself to be the source of Time. This is especially noticeable when there is no other light source in the room, and one lamp determines when it will be light and when it is dark. And if there are no clocks or windows in the room, then this lamp claims to control Time and its manifestations. But just as this lamp knows nothing about the nature of its existence, it does not know when it will go out. And when this happens, its existence is replaced by another exactly the same, with exactly the same qualities. 

The next bulb repeats the whole story of the first, and this goes on ad infinitum. But even all the glaring ignorance of the bulb about how reality works does not stand up to any comparison with the fact that it does not remember that it was screwed into its cartridge by some living being who placed it there intentionally and for a special purpose. And the fact that the lamp does not remember that it was once created is out of the question.

***the Matrix***

The Spider's web was woven in the corner and didn't take up much space, but under it was an even smaller web with a smaller spider. This second spider took no visible part in what was going on in and out of the room. Also, it did not see how the match burned, because it looked in the opposite direction, and it did not get any food. All the flies were eaten by the first spider, both those that fell into the web themselves and those that were brought by one human being. Nothing concrete can be said about this second spider, except that it represented a smaller copy of the first spider. It was located below and it was generally difficult to notice it. But that human being who had some degree of consciousness noticed it and subsequently even internalized the degree of its importance to everything that happened.

The small spider carried the same genetic matrix as the big one. It had all the same qualities. The only difference was the difference in age between these two members of the same species. The presence of this small spider in the room could not be accidental, it, like everything else, indicated some special manifestations of the Time. In this case, it was the principle of preserving the past. Moreover, preservation not as a memory, but as the same material world as the present. 

The big spider, in relation to the small one, was the past when the small one was the present. But it was still young and did not act on its own. Similarly, the present, which human beings perceive as the only truly existing reality, does not have enough time to mature enough to influence something. It cannot be denied that it exists, but there is still very little energy in it. When there is enough of it, it will already be in the past.

It is those events that have already happened that actually govern reality. They determine everything, as they have prepared the conditions for the accomplishment of new events. The old spider prepared everything for the birth and existence of the new spider. And the young spider, reflecting the present, having been born, still cannot do anything with itself. It is completely dependent on its parent. Similarly, the present is completely dependent on the past, and human beings on their ancestors. 

One revolution of the planet is completely dependent on the previous one, and one revolution of the star is completely dependent on its previous one. One light beam depends on the one that passed the same space before it, and the same dependence exists inside everything that is inside the common Time Crystal. On one of its levels there is no present, no past, no future. There are all times at the same Time, and there are all the events that have been and will be. 

If human beings could perceive this level and see it in images, then they would see many balls following one after another. Also, all these balls contain many balls in themselves and they are all inside one ball. Their movement never stops. An event that occurs at one time remains so forever, and this Time, in the form of one of the balls, is shifted into the past. But for this event it is always in the present, for it there is no future. Each separate phase of each separate event does not disappear anywhere and is always in the present. At this level, all time is calculated relative to the ball in which the event occurs.

For human beings, the balls are parallel dimensions and worlds that exist simultaneously. Together, these balls represent a fractal matrix, in which each of them is a separate smaller matrix, consisting of a certain set of even smaller matrices. This manifestation of the common Crystal of Time is embedded in everything that is inside it. This manifestation can be detected with sufficient development of the level of consciousness and the practice of self-remembering. By noticing how every single moment of your existence in the memory of the common Crystal of Time, which is material, one more frame from the life of the common presence is saved, you can go out into the corridor and close the door behind you.

This door must be sealed by attaching one end of the thread to its inside, and placing the other end in a plasticine mold attached to the outer wall. Press the seal tightly into the mold and then the room will be safe. No one except the one with the seal will enter the room unnoticed, as the door will open and destroy the seal. And everything that he does in the room will be imputed to him as the intentional commission of evil or a criminal act. For which the malefactor, of course, will answer sooner or later. For greater security, you can glue the door and the wall with a piece of paper with some kind of terrible curse, and when the door opens, the piece of paper will tear, which again will make the intruder's penetration into the room noticeable. The energy of the curse will be released and will overtake him immediately.
