0. Definitions
"Licensor" means Artur Kraskov, operating as Monada Dominion (KVK 87782324, Eindhoven, Netherlands), and any expressly designated successor rights holder.

"Licensed Material" means all source code, compiled outputs, build scripts, configuration files, infrastructure-as-code, asset files (including images, fonts, audio, video, and data files), written documentation, operational documents, design files, and any other files or content present in or released from this repository or any other repository owned or operated by the Licensor (collectively, the "Project").

"Source Form" means the preferred form for making modifications, including all associated build, configuration, and tooling files.

"Verbatim Copy" means an exact, unmodified copy of the Licensed Material preserving all file contents, directory structure, and embedded notices.

"Non-Commercial Use" means any use that (a) is not conducted for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation of any kind; and (b) is not incorporated into, or used to provision, a product or service offered for a fee, subscription, advertising revenue, data monetization, or other consideration; and (c) does not benefit any for-profit entity's operations, products, or competitive positioning. Academic research, personal study, internal evaluation by a registered non-profit organization, and classroom instruction are Non-Commercial Uses provided no fee is charged specifically for access to, or use of, the Licensed Material beyond cost-recovery for physical media or third-party hosting.

"Commercial Use" means any use that is not Non-Commercial Use. This includes, without limitation: operating the Licensed Material (modified or unmodified) as part of a hosted, managed, or API-accessible service; integrating the Licensed Material into a product sold or licensed to third parties; and using the Licensed Material to gain competitive commercial intelligence.

"Contribution" means any code, documentation, configuration, data, or other material intentionally submitted to the Licensor for inclusion in the Licensed Material, whether submitted via pull request, patch, issue, email, or any other channel.

"AI/ML Training Use" means using the Licensed Material, or any portion thereof, as training data, fine-tuning data, evaluation data, pre-training data, or reinforcement-learning signal for any machine-learning model, large language model, neural network, or other artificial intelligence system, whether conducted by a human or automated pipeline.

1. Grant of Limited Rights
Subject to your full and continuous compliance with this License, the Licensor grants you a personal, worldwide, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license solely to:
 (a) View, read, and execute the Licensed Material in Source Form or compiled form strictly for Non-Commercial Use; and
 (b) Create temporary, transient copies (e.g., in RAM, object code, build artifacts, browser caches) strictly necessary for such Non-Commercial Use; and
 (c) Distribute Verbatim Copies for Non-Commercial Use, provided all requirements of Section 4 (Attribution & Notice) are fully satisfied.

No rights are granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by the Licensor.

2. No Derivatives / Modification Restriction
You may NOT modify, adapt, translate, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer (except solely to the extent mandated by applicable law and only for interoperability purposes), summarize, distill, or create derivative works of the Licensed Material. You may make purely ephemeral, local modifications strictly necessary to (i) configure build parameters (e.g., editing a .env or config file) or (ii) apply security patches you authored for your own internal Non-Commercial Use, provided such modifications are never distributed. ANY distribution of a modified, patched, combined, transformed, or derivative version—partial or complete—is expressly prohibited. Using the Licensed Material as a structural, architectural, or conceptual basis for a separately written work is also prohibited.
