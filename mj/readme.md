# MJ Project

This project contains a collection of Python scripts for processing geographical data and generating creative content from it. The scripts can create interactive maps, fetch live data from web services, and generate "cards" from a text corpus.

---

##  Scripts and Their Functions

### Card Generation

-   `get_72_mj_cards.py`: This script reads the text from `about_the_spider_and_the_time.md`, a large text file, and extracts 72 random sentences to create a deck of "cards," which are saved in `cards.md`.

### Mapping

-   `maps.py`: Generates an interactive HTML map (`divided_map.html`) using the Folium library. The map is centered on a user-provided or random set of coordinates and is divided into 12 radial sections.
-   `maps_to_point_no_data.py`: Similar to `maps.py`, but likely focuses on pointing to specific locations without additional data overlays.
-   `maps_to_point_with_data.py`: An advanced version of the mapping script that likely overlays data points onto the map.
-   `maps_with_data.py`: Another variation of the mapping script that integrates data with the map visualization.

### Data Fetching

-   `fetch_live_data.py`: Fetches a Google Street View image for a specified latitude and longitude using the Google Maps Street View API. **Note:** This script requires a valid Google Cloud API key to function.

## Files

-   `about_the_spider_and_the_time.md`: A large text file that serves as the source material for card generation.
-   `cards.md`: The output file containing the generated cards.
-   `divided_map.html`: The output file for the interactive map.
