## Card 1
Its tiny legs could have repeatedly heated up and cooled down due to the productive work on the creation of the next net or rope.

## Card 2
Moreover, the creatures regularly, for some reason, blew on the spider, because of which he had to crawl deeper into the corner and hide under his web.

## Card 3
An external, uninitiated observer, if there was such a thing, could notice that the match burned for only a few seconds, but for the spider and the one who lit this match, the moment lasted for an eternity.

## Card 4
This distinguishes living and present Time from what the so-called learned human beings think about it.

## Card 5
When the "I"exists, Time does not disappear, and when the "I" does not exist, it disappears.

## Card 6
All this could be observed in the behavior of those human beings who were in a certain relationship with the spider.

## Card 7
Another issue related to poppy fields and having a certain importance in this context is the space-time portal teleportation.

## Card 8
It is in view of this uncertainty associated with the presence of opium that it, like nothing else, is suitable for the study of the nature of Time.

## Card 9
In order to use opium in a different time, a special room was required - the one not subject to decay due to space-time distortions.

## Card 10
Perhaps only the top of the Poppy Dominion  knows this, since it has direct contact with Time.

## Card 11
Such crystals were very valuable and were highly guarded by human beings, but after colossal catastrophes that occurred on planet Earth, there were no singing crystals available for new human beings.

## Card 12
By its nature, a crystal is information, but at different levels of organization of matter, it takes a form corresponding to this level.

## Card 13
So, if the number of elements inside one sphere begins to grow, for example, the number of chickens in a poultry farm, then at first the factory building will be completely filled.

## Card 14
The sphere of public catering can also be compared with this function.

## Card 15
The Spider clan chose not to advertise their participation in the creation of such a formation, since any connections of religion with such an organization could immediately alienate new adherents from relations with it.

## Card 16
Upon closer examination of these processes, the two organizations discovered in their past kinship ties that were rooted in Time.

## Card 17
Considering the fact that the opium trade since time immemorial and contract killings amassed enormous capital for these organizations, the Poppy Dominion  and the Spider Clan had the opportunity to infiltrate any organization existing in the universe and gradually absorb it.

## Card 18
After human beings literally began to die from the use of sweet products containing some dose of heroin, it was decided to replace the final product of the opium industry with its transcendental counterpart, that is, advertising.

## Card 19
Therefore, most likely such a person will die at fifty-four years old, at most fifty-five years old, since he will be an unnecessary ballast for Poppy Dominion.

## Card 20
This situation significantly worsened the state of affairs associated with the production and distribution of the final or intermediate product of the opium industry, more final than intermediate.

## Card 21
If a human being did not perceive all these, at first glance, fundamental differences between waves and atoms, then all sounds, colors, types of matter and phenomena would simply not exist, and everything would be a single monolith.

## Card 22
Also, substances consisting of atoms with different numbers of electrons, protons and neutrons make a human being see and feel matter as consisting of different substances and having different qualities.

## Card 23
Subsequently, buttons were ubiquitous in all activities of human beings.

## Card 24
Accordingly, buttons began to reflect the social status of a person over time.

## Card 25
Everyone else is forced to delve into the details of the nature of time, its distribution and influence.

## Card 26
It does not bother how it knows what it needs to do and why.

## Card 27
In other words, if a human being receiving influences regarding the placement of one similar to himself inside the package contains enough influences in its atmosphere that represent the manifestation of interest in other living beings and the clarification with a high degree of certainty of what it does not know, then when combined, these influences can cause the receiver to cause death to the one from whom it received these influences.

## Card 28
When one of the unconscious human beings sees another carrying something in a package, an interest is spontaneously and immediately generated within the human-being and regarding the contents of this package.

## Card 29
Some of the most conscious members of the poppy family, related to the Poppy Dominion, have the ability to observe what the state of the database will be in the future.

## Card 30
If you do not divide the description of reality into different sciences, such as physics, biology, philosophy, astronomy, mathematics and others, but try to combine all the knowledge and methods of describing reality into one comprehensive system, then the description will be more consistent with the nature of the common Time Crystal.

## Card 31
Such a feature of their behavior caused confusion and an extreme degree of interest among individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion and the Spider Clan.

## Card 32
It has always been known that if someone is destined to die from a spider bite or from an opium injection, then it is useless to resist it, and it is also useless to run away from the assassin's poisoned knife.

## Card 33
Adepts of the Spider Clan, who received direct instructions from the leadership of the Clan and from the Poppy Dominion, arrived in the most remote corners of the planet and in all major cities in order to continue weaving the web there.

## Card 34
Knowing that Time is a Crystal, each particle of which reflects the general structure, the angels could activate and deactivate certain parts of it, thereby concentrating the attention of human beings on them.

## Card 35
Due to the fact that the Spider maintained a fairly close relationship with his family and never severed family ties, he possessed the most perfect skills in all the areas mentioned.

## Card 36
So in those moments when the Spider needed to decide how he should treat some living beings, he took his second body out the door, and allowed the first to do what was most appropriate for the situation.

## Card 37
Sometimes external influences can simply die out after the peak of their activity, and remain at the level of the atmosphere of a human being.

## Card 38
It is in order to know when external influences penetrate the inner world and begin to change it that the ability to separate influences in time is used.

## Card 39
In a small object resembling a badge or patch, vibrations are embedded that contain information designed to organize the relationship of human beings in pre-thought out and planned situations.

## Card 40
Accordingly, when human beings see cyphers, their minds simply undergo a rearrangement of information, which is caused by falling into the atmosphere of cyphering.

## Card 41
This similarity is due to the influence of the same laws on subtle information processes and on gross material ones.

## Card 42
If one of the points of contact contains information about the contact of one world with another, but not with the one with which it actually touches, then one of the worlds will acquire the properties of another, about which information is contained in the point of contact.

## Card 43
The most striking example of the transmission and storage of information in space is the Internet.

## Card 44
Having acquired a sufficient amount of free solar matter in the region of the heart, a human being can direct it like a laser, and inside this laser transmit information in the same way as it happens when writing any information on a CD.

## Card 45
But it was not always so.

## Card 46
But only real spiders, who had perfect information about the structure of the web, could disconnect someone from the knots.

## Card 47
In order to be able to distinguish sounds within a common melody, a conscious being had to practice for a long time in the separation of influences in Time.

## Card 48
Having noticed one sound, an understanding listener could determine how it will develop, and what turn the developing events will take.

## Card 49
Other groups connect these situations and the human beings involved in them.

## Card 50
With enough training in the room where the Spider lived, the creature could get into any part of the general Time Crystal and engage in any of the existing activities.

## Card 51
The main difference between the vision of the single mind of the common Crystal of Time, and the ways of perceiving reality by human beings is that the single mind sees the entire Crystal with all its manifestations and the processes taking place in it.

## Card 52
The higher their level of work, the greater the number of their centers and bodies can work simultaneously.

## Card 53
So orientation in space and time occurs relative to the centers of the first order and their influences.

## Card 54
Of course, these were erroneous principles, but the zeal with which human beings sought to give all manifestations areas of the common Time Crystal of definition gradually made the symbol systems prevail over true perception.

## Card 55
Moreover, if one human being is able to calculate and analyze the state of all human beings who will take part in the work of spreading ideas, then that person must also continue to monitor their states.

## Card 56
Complex schemes and strategies, designed for tens and hundreds of years ahead, actively existed and continue to exist on a planet inhabited by human beings.

## Card 57
The "Koba" system, developed by Poppy Dominion , was based more on mass and brutal murders and less on hypnosis, although significant attention was paid to this point.

## Card 58
During the war, one could observe the mutual performance of opposite functions between the two organizations.

## Card 59
At the same time, first-class weapons were developed that carried out massacres.

## Card 60
When the developments were completed and the bomb was created, the Spider Clan applied it to human beings that inhabited some areas of the globe.

## Card 61
Its entire existence on the planet was connected with the human being who had it in his possession.

## Card 62
Such shocks were produced by Zulfiqar, which was another well-known miracle associated with the personality of the special human being mentioned above.

## Card 63
The Spider knew about it, individual representatives of the Poppy Dominion, of course, the Time, and, in part, the creature itself knew this.

## Card 64
At first glance,these signs came from outside unrelated human beings.

## Card 65
It contains all other symbols and forms, but it lacks them as well.

## Card 66
The Seal of the Poppy Dominion, available to all its representatives without exception, contains all the information and energy available to the Poppy Dominion related to Time.

## Card 67
And the print carrier became a direct transmitter of the orders of the Time, in other words, it performed its functions.

## Card 68
This situation turns each of them into a point filled with nothing but the same useless points.

## Card 69
And if there are no clocks or windows in the room, then this lamp claims to control Time and its manifestations.

## Card 70
But even the Moon, which contributes to the manifestation of everything evil and negative on Earth, cannot be compared in terms of the level of selfishness with some individual representatives of the species of human beings.

## Card 71
This manifestation of the common Crystal of Time is embedded in everything that is inside it.

## Card 72
There are all times at the same Time, and there are all the events that have been and will be.
