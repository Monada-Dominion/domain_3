# üÉè Cards Challenge: From Logic Gates to Quantum Computing

This project is a unique learning journey that uses a card-based challenge system to guide you from the fundamentals of Electrical Engineering to the complexities of advanced computing. Get a card, generate code for it, create a simulation, and synthesize your solutions for FPGAs.

## üöÄ The Concept

The core idea is to learn by doing. Each card represents a specific concept or challenge, starting with basic logic gates and progressively moving towards more complex systems like Quantum and Chaos computers. By completing these challenges, you'll build a "deck" of skills and reusable logic that can be applied to your own projects.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

-   `md_time_cards/`: Contains the primary collection of generated card images that form the basis of the challenges.
-   `themed_decks/`: This directory holds specialized decks of cards, grouped by specific themes or technologies.
-   `webScraper/`: A collection of Python scripts (`webScraper.py`, `webScraperAndTranslate.py`) used to scrape and process data for card generation.

## üç∑ A Final Note

And don't forget that you are a human - get some real VINO.
