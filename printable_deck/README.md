# 🃏 Monada Dominion Time Cards Deck

Welcome to the **MD Time Cards** — a symbolic model of the universe turned into a playable card deck. This printable deck is a precision tool for metaphysical exploration, meditative insight, and symbolic gameplay. Use it to model reality, reveal unconscious archetypes, or simply play an inspired round of "The Integral Fool".

## 🔮 What is MD Time Cards?

**MD Time Cards Deck (MDTCD)** is a metaphysical toolkit disguised as a card game. Based on a 12-color and 12-form system, it allows you to:
- Perceive time symbolically
- Explore patterns of transformation
- Tune in to intuitive, emotional, material, and intellectual flows

**Every card is unique**, combining one of 12 colors (vibrational intensity) and one of 12 figures (process implementation stages).

---

## 🧠 Design Structure

- **72 unique cards** = 12 Colors × 12 Figures
- **Colors** represent levels of vibration (from red → pink)
- **Figures** represent stages of process (dot → hexagonal star)

This structure follows the **law of octaves** and is visually and functionally inspired by musical harmony and the chromatic scale.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Modes

### 🃏 The Integral Fool (2–6 Players)
A universal card game inspired by “The Fool”, restructured using time cards:
- Hierarchies by color and figure
- Trump color dominates others
- Play develops intuition through symbolic logic and archetypal flow

> Formulae used:
> ```
> X ≡ t * m²  → figure = time-weighted attention
> Y ≡ m * t²  → color = mass-weighted experience
> ```

## ✨ Creating an Intent

Post-spread, weak cards may be replaced intuitively to form a powerful intention. Lay cards until a satisfying archetype appears. This process fine-tunes your subconscious toward a preferred scenario.

---

## 🧠 Working with the Subconscious

Regular use of the deck strengthens the bond between your subconscious and the archetypal language of the cards. Ultimately, the deck becomes unnecessary — the symbolic logic becomes part of your intuition.
